"input: Four children were among those rescued by a Royal Navy helicopter after being trapped for about six hours at Nithside Farm near Closeburn. Homes had earlier been evacuated at Kirkconnel, in Dumfries and Galloway, and New Cumnock in East Ayrshire. Flooding also caused disruption on the rail network and several road closures. Police in Dumfries and Galloway warned drivers not to travel unless it was ""absolutely necessary"". While all the main trunk routes were said to be passable with care in the area, many minor routes were closed or disrupted and some cars were abandoned. Travel Check if this is affecting your journey With more rain forecast on Tuesday morning, police said further flooding and disruption was possible. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency had more than 30 flood warnings in place on Monday evening. The seven people who were trapped upstairs at Nithside Farm - a father, four children under the age of eight and two holidaymakers - were rescued at about 19:00. Two dogs were also rescued, and all those involved were said to be safe and well. Elsewhere, heavy rain and winds of almost 80mph battered parts of Wales, affecting roads and train services. Met Office amber ""be prepared"" warnings for parts of Dumfries and Galloway and Ayrshire have now been lifted but yellow ""be aware"" warnings remain in place for these areas and much of central and southern Scotland. There is also a yellow warning for wind in Wales, north-west and north-east England, Yorkshire and Humber, the East Midlands, south-west England and London and the South East. There are yellow warnings for rain in Wales, Northern Ireland and south-west England. In Scotland, Dumfries and Galloway and parts of Ayrshire have been worst affected. In the village of Carsphairn, in Dumfries and Galloway, residents described the conditions as some of the worst they had experienced in 40 years. Police said major roads across the region were affected by flooding including the A74(M) at Greenhillstairs, the A76 at Kirkconnel and the A75 at various points. About 40 houses in the St Conal's Square area of Kirkconnel were evacuated and a rest and welfare centre has been set up at the village's Miners Hall. Police said the village of Moniaive was almost cut off at one point due to flooding on the A702, and a family had to be evacuated from a bungalow which was cut off by flood water. Firefighters used rescue boats to assist with the evacuations. Homes in Port Logan and Newton Stewart also had to be evacuated. The Whitesands in Dumfries has flooded after the River Nith burst its banks. Electricity supply to this area has also been affected. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said it had attended 55 incidents which involved flooding or water rescues in the Strathclyde and Dumfries and Galloway area between 08:00 GMT and 18:00 GMT on Monday. One woman had to be rescued from a stranded car in Moffat. A number of properties were evacuated in Dundee after a landslide. Police Scotland said heavy rain had caused a wall to collapse at the rear of Gardner Street at about 16:00. No-one was injured, but properties were evacuated as a precautionary measure and some roads were closed in the area. Police Scotland said eight people had been evacuated from their homes in Mansefield Road in New Cumnock, and a further six homes were evacuated in the Leggate area. Police, fire crews and staff from the council and Scottish Water and Scottish Gas remained at the scene. In Glasgow, the M77 southbound entry slip was closed because of flooding at Junction 2 Barrhead Road. Trains from London Euston station to Edinburgh and Glasgow were disrupted by flooding. Virgin Trains said there were no services running between Carlisle and Carstairs, because of flooding between Lockerbie and Carstairs.

"input: By Katherine SellgrenBBC News education reporter The poll found 49% of primary schools and 57% of secondaries have cut back on TAs, while 18% of primaries and 54% of secondaries have cut teaching staff. Information technology (IT) equipment and trips and outings are also being scaled back, it suggested. The government said school funding was at record levels. IT equipment is being cut back by 35% of primaries and 38% of secondaries, the survey of 1,361 teachers by the National Foundation for Educational Research found. Outings and trips are being affected in nearly a third of schools - 30% of primary and 32% of secondary schools. Pupil premium The poll also suggested some schools are using funding for disadvantaged pupils (the pupil premium) to subsidise the school budget. Of the 420 senior leaders who took part in the survey, 32% of primary and 27% of secondary senior staff say the pupil premium is being used to plug gaps elsewhere in the school's budget. Sir Peter Lampl, founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust and chairman of the Education Endowment Foundation, said: ""Our new polling adds to the growing evidence from highly credible sources that the squeeze on school budgets is having a detrimental effect on schools. ""Many are having to get rid of teachers to close these funding gaps. ""Of particular concern is that schools are having to use funding for poorer pupils to plug gaps in their finances. ""The pupil premium should be used for highly cost-effective interventions such as peer tutoring and pupil feedback."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: ""All schools are trusted to use this [pupil] premium to ensure it meets the needs of their students and are held to account by Ofsted for how disadvantaged pupils benefit from the extra funding."" ""We recognise that schools are facing cost pressures and we will continue to provide support to help them use their funding in cost-effective ways,"" the spokeswoman said.

"input: By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor It describes Project Alloy as being a ""merged reality"" device. One key advantage, Intel says, is that users will be able to see their own hands. It intends to offer the technology to other manufactures next year, but will not sell the headsets itself. The company is keen to avoid repeating the mistake it made with smartphones. The California-based company has previously acknowledged that it botched an opportunity to supply Apple with chips for its original iPhone. It subsequently lost out to rival ARM-based technology that now powers the vast majority of handsets. Project Alloy marks an opportunity to pitch its RealSense depth-sensing cameras, Replay graphics-creation software and other proprietary inventions to others before virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) devices - which superimpose graphics over a real-world view - go mainstream. Even so, it is far from being the only technology giant involved in the sector: Furthermore, AMD - a rival chipmaker to Intel - is developing an untethered headset of its own that mixes together AR and VR technologies. No cord or controller Intel's chief executive, Brian Krzanich, offered a first look at Project Alloy at his company's developer forum in San Francisco, where he suggested the technology could ""redefine what is possible with computing"". One of the benefits of its approach, he said, was that the headset's RealSense cameras could detect a user's finger movements and allow them to appear in a virtual world and manipulate simulated objects. ""Merged reality is about more natural ways of interacting with and manipulating virtual environments,"" he said in a blog later published on Medium. ""[That liberates] you from the controllers and the nunchucks of today's VR systems by immersing your hands - your real-life hands - into your simulated experiences."" In an on-stage demonstration, the hands could be seen only if they were held near to the centre of the user's field of view. When Mr Krzanich's own face appeared within the VR world, it also became apparent that ""merged reality"" objects only appeared as low resolution graphics, at least for now. He added that the technology had benefits over rival systems that required a user to install external sensors in their room to detect their movements. And he suggested that going wireless would prevent an owner being ""jolted"" out of their experience because they had reached the limit of the cord used to transmit data from a PC or games console. However, he acknowledged that one trade-off would be that the computer involved would take slightly longer to respond to a user's actions - something that might concern gamers. Virtual advances Microsoft has pledged to support the headset in a forthcoming version of Windows 10. One expert said Project Alloy had promise, but it might only have limited appeal. ""Having a real-time rendition of your hands or other objects in VR could have appeal to enterprise applications, such as a surgeon training with a body diagram or a mechanic having graphics overlaid onto an engine part,"" said Ed Barton, from the technology consultancy Ovum. ""But when it comes to gaming, there hasn't been much clamour to be able to see your hands in real-time. ""Vive, for example, has addressed the issue with special controllers. It's not something that people have been crying out for."" The unveiling of Project Alloy comes seven months after Intel disclosed some of its other VR and AR efforts. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, it showed off an augmented reality helmet for construction workers, made by the start-up Daqri, and a smartphone virtual reality accessory made by IonVR. Both incorporated its RealSense sensors.

"input: New Zealand-born Sgt Ratana, known as Matt, was shot in the chest in Croydon as a suspect, who was still in handcuffs, was being checked in. Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick described the 54-year-old as ""talented officer"" who was ""big in heart"". After the shooting at about 02:15 BST the suspect, 23, is then thought to have shot himself. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the man was arrested on suspicion of possession of Class B drugs with intent to supply and possession of ammunition. He is currently in a critical condition in hospital. The IOPC confirmed he was handcuffed with his hands behind his back and had been taken to the custody centre in a police vehicle, before being escorted into the building. The shots were fired as officers prepared to search the suspect, who was still handcuffed, with a metal detector, the IOPC said. ""A non-police issue firearm, which appears to be a revolver, has been recovered from the scene. Further ballistic work will be required,"" said IOPC regional director Sal Naseem. A minute's silence was held at 16:00 BST at New Scotland Yard and Croydon Police Station to pay tribute to Sgt Ratana, who was heavily involved in rugby coaching when he was not working. He would have been eligible for retirement in just two months. ""Matt spent very nearly 30 years as a uniformed police officer serving the public of London,"" said Dame Cressida. ""He will be remembered so fondly in Croydon and missed there, as well as in the Met and the rugby world,"" she said. She added that he ""leaves a partner and he leaves an adult son from a previous relationship. Our thoughts are with them."" Sgt Ratana joined the Met in 1991, having moved to the UK in 1989. He was originally from the Hawke's Bay area of New Zealand and was educated at Palmerston North Boy's High School's, a town north of the capital, Wellington. He served in various parts of London including Hackney and Selhurst, with his last posting as custody sergeant in Croydon, where he managed suspects who are brought into the cells. ""He worked in our detention command at Croydon but frequently volunteered for duty in custody suites across London,"" Dame Cressida added. Sgt Ratana had led rugby teams in Worthing, close to Goring-by-Sea where he then lived and in East Grinstead, where he was living when he died. Ryan Morlen, assistant head coach at East Grinstead Rugby Club, described him as ""an absolutely lovely bloke"". ""He is a bloke who is just so passionate about what he does - it does not matter whether you're the most talented or least talented, he will treat you equal,"" he said. Earlier, BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said it was believed the suspect was known to counter-terrorism police. He had been referred to the anti-extremism ""Prevent"" programme, though the Met said the murder inquiry was not being treated as terrorism-related. The Met said a murder investigation was under way, but the shooting was not being treated as a counter-terrorism incident. Dame Cressida said she understood ""the great concern about how this happened"" and that officers ""will establish the facts"". ""We owe it to Matt, his loved ones and all other officers. But we need to give investigators space to do their job,"" she said. London's Mayor Sadiq Khan earlier said the police were currently ""reviewing the safety of custody suites"" and ""there could be changes very soon"". Police officers and members of the public have been arriving at Croydon Police Station during the day to lay tributes. The owner of a gym in Lancing, Sussex, told the BBC how Sgt Ratana had helped when his business was going through financial difficulty. Neil Donohue, 54, said: ""He came in one day and gave me 200 quid out of the blue, I said no no, I can't accept that and gave it back to him. ""But the next day he wired it into my account. That's the sort of guy he was."" A number of police officers have been turning their social media profile pictures black with a blue stripe to pay their respects. John Davies, a retired officer who worked with Sgt Ratana when he was based in Hillingdon, said he was ""a truly remarkable, strong and unique individual"" who ""left an impression on all those he came into contact with"". East Grinstead RFC also released a tribute to their ""much-loved"" head coach. ""Matt was an inspiring and much-loved figure at the club and there are truly no words to describe how we are feeling,"" said Bob Marsh, the club's chairman, and the club's president Andy Poole.

"input: Police came under attack in Newtownards Road, where 200 loyalists congregated. One officer was injured in Sandy Row, near the city centre, when paint bombs, fireworks and bricks were thrown. South Belfast, Lisburn, Carrickfergus and Portadown also saw trouble. Police said they had arrested 15 people in total, including an 11-year-old child. The latest trouble comes after more than two weeks of demonstrations by loyalists over the decision by Belfast City Council to stop flying the union flag every day. BBC Ireland correspondent Mark Simpson says the latest violence was ""low level"" but happened in a wide range of areas. He says a 12-year-old and two 13-year-olds were also among those arrested. Political leaders at Stormont have made repeated calls for the violence to stop but the protesters are simply ignoring them, our correspondent says. 'Totally unacceptable' The PSNI said about 80 protests took place across the province on Monday, with numbers ranging from small groups to hundreds of people. They have appealed for an end to the violence. Assistant Chief Constable Dave Jones said: ""While most of the protests were peaceful, the violence witnessed in some areas tonight is totally unacceptable. ""This is now the third week of protests and I am appealing to everyone involved to take a step back from this. It cannot and should not continue."" In Portadown, a man was taken to hospital after being injured in a road accident during a protest. In south Belfast, protesters set fire to bins and placed them across the Donegall Road near the City Hospital. In Gaol Square, Armagh city, police arrested a 19-year-old man after a firework was thrown at police from a crowd of protesters. Following a protest at Carrickfergus, about 11 miles from Belfast, protesters entered the town hall, disrupted a meeting and threatened councillors. No-one was injured. Police dispersed the crowd and people were able to leave the building. Alliance Party Councillor Noel Williams said that about five protesters infiltrated a meeting of Carrickfergus Borough Council ""and carried out a full frontal attack on democracy"". He said councillors were subjected to verbal abuse by about five protesters who banged on desks and chairs. ""It is unacceptable that the town hall was not under police surveillance, especially as violence has broken out at previous protests,"" he said. ""People have a right to protest peacefully, but this incident tonight put many people's safety at risk and must not be tolerated."" In Lisburn, County Antrim, a crowd blocked Longstone Street. Police have asked people to avoid the area. At Shaw's Bridge, in south Belfast, police diverted traffic as youths attempted to hijack vehicles. The road has now been re-opened. Protests also took place in Londonderry and Ballyclare. The protests, initially timed to coincide with the rush hour, were also held in several areas of Belfast including the Albertbridge Road, Newtownards Road and Limestone Road. About 50 loyalists blocked traffic at Glendermott Road in Londonderry. A similar number disrupted traffic at the junction of Tates Avenue and Boucher Road in Belfast. Earlier on Monday, the leaders of the DUP and UUP, Peter Robinson and Mike Nesbitt, appealed to loyalists to call off the protests. Impassable Police closed the M2 Fortwilliam off-slip to the Shore Road because of a protest at Mount Vernon. In south Belfast, the Ormeau Road re-opened after being blocked for a period The Upper Malone Road at the House of Sport has also re-opened following a protest at the Dub. In the north of the city, the Limestone Road was blocked at York Street and the Crumlin Road at Hesketh Park. In Londonderry, drivers were advised to avoid the Glendermott Road into the city and the Rossdowney Road. Ballyclare town centre, Coleraine and Broughshane village were also blocked by protesters.

"input: Ilham Tohti, an economics professor in Beijing, has been critical of China's ethnic policies. He has been detained by police since last month. The US and EU have expressed concern over Mr Tohti's detention. The Muslim Uighur group mostly live in Xinjiang, in China's far west. There are sporadic clashes in the region. The government traditionally blames extremists for the violence. Uighur activists, on the other hand, point to ethnic tensions and tight Chinese control as triggers for violence. 'Ridiculous' Mr Tohti's wife, Guzaili Nu'er, said she received an arrest warrant and notice of the separatism charges on Tuesday. He was being detained in Xinjiang, she added. She told Reuters news agency the charges were ""ridiculous"". ""He's never done anything like this. He is a teacher,"" she said. Mr Tohti's lawyer, Li Fangping, said he had travelled to Urumqi, Xinjiang's capital, to see his client, but had been denied access so far. ""From my knowledge of him and his statements, nothing constitutes the charge of [inciting] secession,"" he told AP news agency. Chinese state media have previously said that Mr Tohti was being investigated for ""separatist activities"". Mr Tohti has been critical of China's treatment of the Uighurs and recently expressed fears on his website about increased pressure on the minority group following last October's deadly attack in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. A car crashed through a crowd and burst into flames, killing five people. Beijing authorities have blamed the incident on Uighur separatists. Xinjiang has experienced several violent clashes in recent months. According to China state media reports, 11 people were killed in clashes with police earlier this month, while 12 people died in an outbreak of violence in January. Confirming details of these incidents is difficult, because foreign media access to the region is tightly controlled. China has restricted Mr Tohti's movements on several occasions since deadly ethnic rioting in Urumqi in 2009 that left about 200 people dead. In January, the US State Department said Mr Tohti's detention appeared ""to be part of a disturbing pattern of arrests and detentions of public interest lawyers, Internet activists, journalists, religious leaders and others who peacefully challenge official Chinese policies and actions"".

"input: Karl Turner, Emma Hardy and Diana Johnson fear thousands of jobs are at risk because of the pandemic disrupting much of the seasonal trade. According to the National Caravan Council, East Yorkshire is at the ""centre of caravan manufacturing"". The Treasury said there was a wide range of schemes for different sectors. Mr Turner, MP for Hull East, said the 20,000 jobs were ""either directly in or related to"" production and sales. ""As a seasonal business, there is a very real threat that if support is not continued, we will see job losses later in the year,"" he said. ""We must not see a repeat of what happened to the industry locally after the 2008 crash."" In a letter to Chancellor Rishi Sunak, the MPs said the industry contributed £9bn a year to the UK economy and that it was at ""serious risk of collapse without further support for the sector"". ""A flexible, sector-focused approach to ending the furlough scheme, that allows manufacturers to respond to market conditions, would allow the industry to come through this crisis,"" the MPs said in the letter, adding that ""livelihoods depend on the survival of this industry"". A Treasury spokesperson said it would ""continue to support businesses as the economy reopens and people return to work"" with measures including business rates holidays and cash grants of up to £25,000 for eligible firms.

"input: But when David Wyn Rowlands, a former guard at RAF Valley in Anglesey, tried to raise standards, he said he was victimised by lower-ranking colleagues. Mr Rowlands claims they intentionally tried to reactivate his post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The MoD said the allegations were investigated and resolved at the time. Booby-trapped phone In 2010, when Prince William was stationed at RAF Valley working as a search and rescue helicopter pilot, security standards had slipped, Mr Rowlands claimed, although the prince had his own security arrangements. Mr Rowlands, from Holyhead, said that on more than one occasion, his team were put on a high state of alert after receiving intelligence that ""interested people"" had been spotted near the base. In spite of this, he said that sleeping on sentry duty was ""common"" and when he punished lower ranking colleagues, they would ""take it out"" on him. He claimed these colleagues damaged his car, defaced pictures and documents and made loud noises near him, in an attempt to trigger the post traumatic stress disorder he had suffered earlier in his military career. On one occasion, Mr Rowlands claimed they booby-trapped his phone so that when he answered, a loud bang was set off. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said that ""bullying and harassment have no place in the armed forces and will not be tolerated"". Mr Rowlands joined the Military Provost Guard Service after a 22-year career in the Welsh Guards and Parachute Regiment, serving in the Falklands and Northern Ireland. In 2010 he said the ""ethos and command structure"" at the base had also ""broken down"". When he complained to his superiors, he said he was not supported and was instead put on paid leave and not allowed to return to work. He said he was later threatened with disciplinary action by his managers who tried to transfer him to another RAF base more than 100 miles away. Mr Rowlands said he made 15 complaints in three years. Eventually, he suffered a nervous breakdown and was medically discharged. A tribunal ruled that he had suffered mental illness and depression, predominantly caused by his service. An MoD spokesperson said that ""allegations of security failings were investigated and resolved at the time"".

"input: Conservative Derrick Murphy has temporarily stood down as leader to contest complaints relating to an email about the leader of another council. George Nobbs, county council Labour group leader, said the public might question any decision by the standards committee, which includes five Tories. Mr Murphy said he had no comment. A date has yet to be confirmed but the council's standards committee hearing is expected to take place on 1 February. 'Very difficult position' The panel is made up of five Conservatives, one Liberal Democrat and one Green councillor. ""It puts them in a very difficult position. Whatever way they go, people are going to question their motive,"" said Mr Nobbs. ""I don't doubt that they will come to an honest conclusion but the public will not see it that way. ""From the point of view of public perception, we should ask a neighbouring authority to look at this for us."" The complaints against Mr Murphy relate to an email sent by Kevin Vaughan, a Conservative political assistant at County Hall, regarding West Norfolk Council's Conservative leader Nick Daubney. An independent investigation, commissioned by the council, concluded that in sending the email, Mr Vaughan had been acting on Mr Murphy's wishes. 'Make it public' Mr Daubney said the email was a ""serious attempt to undermine my position"" and has called on Mr Murphy to stand down permanently. Henry Bellingham, Conservative MP for West Norfolk, said the county council should make public the report it commissioned from local government expert Jenni Richards QC, which concluded Mr Murphy had a case to answer. ""I think it's quite important that Jenni Richards attends the meeting of the standards committee, which the rules allow, so she can answer questions and provide advice,"" he said. ""In the interests of transparency and openness, why can't the meeting be open to the press and public? That would put a lot of people's minds at rests."" Mr Murphy has already said that he had requested a public hearing. and expected to be cleared by the committee. The email at the centre of the controversy was sent last April by Mr Vaughan to BBC Radio Norfolk. 'Serious leadership challenge' It was sent two days before Mr Daubney, leader of West Norfolk Council, was due to appear on the station to discuss a proposed waste incinerator at Saddlebow, King's Lynn. The incinerator is backed by the county council but opposed by West Norfolk Council. The email, released after a Freedom of Information request, said that Mr Daubney was facing ""a serious leadership challenge"" and that his council had failed to procure alternative technology to the plant. Norfolk County Council said it took ""appropriate action"" but that Mr Vaughan's actions had not warranted his dismissal. However, he later resigned after declining an offer of redeployment within the authority. Mr Murphy has said he plans to call him as a witness at the standards hearing.

"input: ""Healthy foods are three times more expensive calorie-for-calorie than unhealthy foods so there's a very strong price differential in a typical basket,"" says Anna Taylor, executive director of the independent think tank Food Foundation. Vegetables are getting cheaper but, she says, there are people who ""haven't got enough money to put food on the table, so for them, trying to secure 10 portions of fruit and veg a day in their diets would be impossible."" The study by Imperial College London, calculated that increasing our fruit and veg intake to 10-a-day could prevent 7.8 million premature deaths each year. But currently only around a quarter of adults in the UK achieve the five-a-day target. The British Heart Foundation did a survey which found that a third of UK adults are struggling to afford to eat healthily. So is 10-a-day realistically affordable? ""For some people it is,"" says Victoria Taylor, senior dietitian at the BHF. ""But for others it would take some serious thought and commitment in terms of working out which fruit and vegetables will be affordable. But it's important to keep in mind that our target is five a day and this study found that the best effects were seen for people who are currently getting below this number. ""The focus on 10 is, in a sense, moving the goalposts and it would be a shame if this put people off aiming for five, or even just having one more portion a day."" The British Dietetic Association says: ""What it tells us is that the benefits of eating fruit and vegetables are incremental - in other words eating five portions a day is great, but 10 a day is even better."" So any improvement in your fruit and vegetable intake is a benefit. Victoria Taylor says cost is not the only reason we don't eat enough fruit and veg. ""There are numerous factors that influence our food choice. Cost is important but so is taste, cooking skills, storage facilities and ability to get to and from the shops. It's hard to say how much is specifically due to the price of food as all of these issues are interrelated."" Tips on buying fruit and veg Source: BHF and BDA The Food Foundation is hosting a conference in June bringing together businesses, farmers, retailers and government departments which aims to make it easier for people to eat vegetables. Some of the ideas they will be looking at are current pilots in America where if food stamps are spent on fruit and veg, they can be doubled in value so ""you create a positive incentive for people to spend their vouchers on fruit and veg because you're giving them more value"". Another scheme sees people who have early stage type 2 diabetes or are pre-diabetic being prescribed fruit and veg and getting vouchers to spend in local markets ""to help them rethink their diets and get their diets on track"". Why did we write this article? We asked BBC readers to send us their questions about the 10-a-day diet and then our health team wrote this piece to try to answer as many as possible. A lot of people asked about the cost implications of trying to achieve a 10-a-day diet. Gary asked: ""Should fruit and vegetables be heavily subsidized by the government to encourage further consumption?"" Gary explained to us the thinking behind his question: ""Simple consumer habits dictate that people consume more of something when it is cheaper. I believe the same economic principle can be applied to fruit and vegetables. When people go shopping, they have to make the choice of what to buy, and usually, the best value items win."" With concern over the cost of healthy eating, some have asked whether the government should subsidise fruit and veg? At the moment, the government has ""measures in place to support low income families, pregnant women and children under four through Healthy Start Vouchers. These can be spent on milk, fresh or frozen fruit and vegetables."" They also point out that all infant pupils can now get free school meals and they've announced £10m funding a year to expand breakfast clubs in up to 1,600 schools. Currently only 70% of those eligible get the healthy start vouchers and Anna Taylor says the Food Foundation will debate whether that programme should be expanded to include a broader income group or wider age range at its conference. As she points out, this ""would create a positive pull of demand - and thereby help to strengthen the British horticulture sector at the same time."" And she thinks in the post-Brexit world there is a big opportunity to help farmers. ""Doesn't it make sense to join up our farming policy with our health policy and think about - could we increase consumer subsidies to really drive up demand so our horticulturalists benefit as well - it's win-win."" ""There are lots of different ways we could make it easier to eat veg - which go beyond price and much more about our whole food environment and to what extent fruit and veg is a strong part of that and encouraging us to eat it."" She points out when you look at advertising only ""1% of food and soft drink advertising spend goes on fresh veg"". But she believes we need to change our whole way of thinking about fruit and veg and the messages we send - even down to children's TV where, she says, it is ""demonised"". ""It's set against delicious and junk food or cream cakes, and fruit and veg is the yucky thing that kids don't want to eat. There's a bit of that subliminal stuff that happens in kids' TV because it's funny but it's kind of normalising that this is stuff that you don't want to be eating - so there's a job of work there beyond advertising, in broadcasting to try and not normalise that this is worthy but not tasty.""

"input: The Health Hydro in Milton Road, Swindon, has been upgraded from Grade II listed status by Historic England. Operator Greenwich Leisure Limited had said it was considering converting it into residential space but a petition urging the firm not to close or alter the baths attracted 7,000 signatures. The upgraded status would mean Historic England would have to be consulted about any renovations or developments. Historic England said it upgraded the status of the building, which is owned by the local authority, in recognition of its historic and architectural interest. The hydro was designed to provide health and welfare services for workers at Brunel's Great Western Railway repair works in the town in the early 1900s. As well as swimming and Turkish baths, the building housed numerous medical services including a dispensary. Sally Hawson from Save Swindon's Heritage, the group that set up the petition, said: ""I am delighted that this building has finally got the listing it deserves and the recognition that it is a unique gem that merits protection for future generations. ""I am hopeful that this new grading will now provide the protection this building has been crying out for and that greater respect for the building will now be enforced by the council."" In June, Historic England and the local authority announced they would jointly invest £7.6m in regeneration works which included improving the condition of the hydro. Dale Heenan, from Swindon Borough Council, said: ""The council welcomes the outside recognition that this building is now of national importance and is of special interest, warranting every effort to preserve it."" In 2016, Greenwich Leisure Limited announced it would conduct a feasibility study into ""the best way to secure the future of the Hydro for generations to come"". At the time it said the building ""has numerous long-term maintenance issues, resulting in the hydro currently operating at a loss"". The company has been approached by the BBC for comment.

"input: Police are investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of Ronan Hughes, 17, from Coalisland. He died on Friday, 5 June. His funeral took place at St Patrick's Church in Clonoe, where he and his brother Cathal were altar boys. Parish priest Fr Benny Fee told mourners it was a ""bitter, bitter privilege to welcome Ronan here to St Patrick's where he was no stranger"". ""Ronan did not take his own life but his life was taken from him, and somewhere in the world, maybe far, far away from Clonoe, is a man, a woman or a gang who are guilty of a heinous crime,"" Fr Fee said. ""People took advantage of his youth and his beauty. They exploited him and they broke him. And if they could do it to him, they could do it to anyone. May God forgive them."" Pupils from Ronan's school, St Joseph's Grammar in Donaghmore, County Tyrone, formed a guard of honour at the church. Concerns Police have said a crime is not suspected and inquiries are continuing. They have issued advice to young people about the need to be careful when using social networking sites. Mid-Ulster district commander Supt Mike Baird described the boy's death as ""tragic"". It is understood that Ronan had told his parents and the police of his concerns about the online images last week. St Joseph's Grammar head teacher, Geraldine Donnelly, published a statement on the school's website expressing sadness at the ""untimely death of our dear pupil"". He was also a talented Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) player and a member of Clonoe O'Rahilly's GAA club in County Tyrone. In a statement, the club said they were ""shocked and saddened"" by his death. They described him as a ""quiet and modest young lad who was popular among all players and coaches"". ""His death has left a dark shadow hanging over our club,"" they said. SDLP councillor Malachy Quinn told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster that Ronan ""had everything to live for"". ""For these people to bring somebody like that down to the point where they think they have no way out - you can't really imagine just what would go through a young person's mind for that to happen,"" he said. Global Online safety expert Wayne Denner said the case showed the impact of technology on the lives of young people and the challenges that can bring. ""Mistakes are going to be made, but we need to educate [young people] on how to take control of their online reputation and how to use social media and the internet to their advantage, not to their disadvantage,"" Mr Denner said. ""Don't connect with people you don't know, know how to set up your privacy settings, and fundamentally, don't post anything online that you're not happy with going on a global billboard. ""Effectively, once it makes its way online it's very difficult to take it down."" ChildLine, the counselling service for children provided by the NSPCC, has been working with the Internet Watch Foundation and can help young people under 18 to get online images removed. A spokeswoman for Childline said: ""Cyber-bullying is a huge concern and the 24-hour nature of the internet means they can feel like there's no escape. ""We must ensure young people have the confidence to speak out against this abuse, so that they don't feel isolated and without anywhere to turn.""

"input: The seasonal outing of ITV's popular period drama will be screened at 20:30 GMT - the same time as BBC One's flagship soap. Doctor Who will be screened at 19:30 GMT, going head to head with an hour-long Coronation Street on ITV. Downton's third Christmas special sees the action shift to 1923 and has US actor Paul Giamatti joining the cast. The two-hour episode centres on the Crawleys' wayward family member Rose being presented at Buckingham Palace, a grand occasion that sees Cora's mother Martha - played by Shirley MacLaine - return to the drama. It will also see Giamatti makes his Downton debut as Martha's brother Harold, who was in trouble with the law at the end of the last series. The show's producers are keeping tight-lipped about the fate of Lady Edith and her pregnancy, saying only that she is ""wrestling with a moral dilemma"". Last year's Christmas Day special climaxed in the unexpected death of Downton heir Matthew Crawley, leaving behind his wife, Lady Mary, and their newborn son. Its first hour overlapped with EastEnders in 2012. Final audience figures gave EastEnders the edge, scoring 11.2 million viewers over Downton's 10.2 million. This year the second hour of Downton Abbey's seasonal special will be up against BBC One sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys. The Christmas Day episode of Doctor Who will see Matt Smith battle deadly enemies, including the Daleks and the Cybermen, before regenerating into Peter Capaldi. In BBC One's schedule, the sci-fi drama finds itself sandwiched between Call the Midwife and EastEnders. Albert Square will see the arrival of a new landlord for the Queen Vic pub, Mick Carter, played by Danny Dyer. The ongoing murder storyline involving Janine Butcher is also expected to figure highly in EastEnders' hour-long special. On the cobbles of Coronation Street, producers have revealed that Leanne and Nick Tilsley's relationship will take a turn for a worse. Yet the tragic storyline involving long-serving character Hayley Cropper is not expected to end until early next year.

"input: By Daniel Gordon & Joshua NevettBBC World Service As World War Two reached its crescendo, the actions of two people left an indelible mark on Dr Ervin Staub's life. Born in Hungary to a Jewish family, he was a six-year-old child when Nazi German forces occupied Hungary in 1944. At the behest of the Nazis, hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews were rounded up and deported to extermination camps. Two decisive interventions ensured Dr Staub and his family did not meet the same fate. A woman named Maria Gogan hid him and his one-year-old sister with a Christian family. ""She looked after us kids,"" Dr Staub told the BBC. ""I was walking with her and my sister in Budapest when the German tanks rolled in."" For a while, Dr Staub and his sister posed as Ms Gogan's relatives from the countryside. Then, when Dr Staub's mother obtained protective identity papers for his family from Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg, they moved into a safe house nearby. To Dr Staub, Ms Gogan was a second mother. She continued to live with the family at the safe house, risking her life to bring them food and pass another letter of protection to Dr Staub's father through the barbed wire of a forced-labour camp. One time, as Ms Gogan returned home, she was held up at knifepoint by Hungarian Nazis. They threatened to kill her for helping Jews. ""A man who knew her came in and said, 'let her go, she's a good person'. So they let her go,"" Dr Staub said. Thanks to these acts of kindness, Dr Staub and his family lived to see the end of Nazi tyranny in Hungary. After enduring the war, and a decade of communism in Hungary, Dr Staub fled via Vienna to the US, where he studied the psychology of violence, genocide and morality. He did a PhD on the topic at Stanford University and taught at Harvard University, before applying his theories on harm prevention to experiments and field research. For a project in Rwanda, for example, he tried to promote reconciliation after the country's genocide of 1994. Fittingly enough, his most recent book was titled ""The Roots of Goodness and Resistance to Evil"". Nowadays, it's not genocide that worries Dr Staub. It's the excessive use of force by police officers in the US. To quell this violence, Dr Staub had a simple idea, one that hinges on the role of active bystanders like Ms Gogan and the diplomat who saved his life. ""These people were heroic active bystanders who put themselves into great danger,"" Dr Staub said. ""They had a huge influence on my motivation to study what leads people to help others."" At 82, Dr Staub is enjoying a renaissance of his school of thought. His active-bystander concept has started to gain traction in 2020, a year of reckoning for police forces in the US. The case of George Floyd, a black man who died in custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota in May, reignited a long-running debate about racial injustice and policing in the US. Widespread calls for police reform have sprung from the killing of Mr Floyd, and that of other black Americans. At more than 30 police departments across the US, a training programme based on Dr Staub's ideas has been included in that push for reform. More on policing and protests in the US: Dr Staub has long stepped back from teaching at the University of Massachusetts, where he founded a PhD course on the psychology of violence. He was thinking about retiring for good this year, but demand for this training has thrust him back into the fray of the police-reform movement in the middle of a pandemic. With a youthful inquisitiveness that belies his age, Dr Staub has acquainted himself with the trappings of 2020, from video conferences on Zoom to the demands of Black Lives Matter protests. Times have changed yet for Dr Staub, the principles of ethical policing training finally appear to be coming of age. ""Some people want to defund police departments,"" Dr Staub said. ""We do need police, but we also need a transformation in police departments."" The training, called Ethical Policing Is Courageous (EPIC), encourages officers to intervene if they see misconduct within their ranks. It was first introduced by the police force in the Louisiana city of New Orleans in 2014. Crucially, it emphasises the responsibility, not of the perpetrator, but of bystanders. Every officer is reminded of their duty to act if they see bad behaviour, repudiating the so-called blue wall of silence. This ethos upends the way officers traditionally think about loyalty to their partners. ""Loyalty isn't saying, 'well, you've done something wrong, I'm going to protect you',"" Lisa Kurtz, an innovation manager at the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD), told the BBC. ""Loyalty is me saying, 'you're about to do something wrong, and I'm going to stop you'."" Ernest Luster, a veteran NOPD officer, said the training has completely changed the dynamic of policing in the city. ""There was always this perception with police of us versus them, of them against us,"" says Mr Luster, a sergeant with more than 20 years' experience. ""Now we're working together to make the community safe."" Mr Luster usually starts his shift with a team briefing. He reminds his colleagues to protect the community, from criminals and each other. On the beat, officers can wear EPIC pins on their lapels to signal they consent to intervention. Ultimately, the sergeant wants the public to see officers as heroes, not villains. To that end, he likens an active bystander to Superman, ""one of my biggest heroes of all time"". Knowing how, and when, to step in is a lesson that every member of the force is taught in EPIC training. And no one, not even the sergeant himself, is exempt from that lesson. ""You can have 50 years on the job, but you're still a human being,"" he said. ""You're still vulnerable to certain people pushing a button."" Even Mr Luster, an EPIC trainer, can recall an incident when he struggled to keep his emotions in check. He almost hit a handcuffed man who had resisted arrest for trespassing. ""At that moment, a rookie cop walks over to me. He puts his hands on my chest, and immediately I thought about EPIC. Just like that. And I walked away. Now, had he not done that, I could have lost my job for excessive force."" Mr Luster's testimony certainly chimes with recent data on police conduct in New Orleans. The EPIC programme, alongside other reforms, appear to have yielded results. A 2019 report by an independent police monitor noted a sharp drop in ""critical incidents"" involving the use of force by officers in New Orleans. These incidents fell from 22 in 2012, to five in 2018. That year, the NOPD did not shoot at, critically injure or kill any civilians, the report said. Satisfaction with police has increased, too. A 2019 survey found that 54% of New Orleans residents were satisfied with the NOPD's overall performance, a rise of 21% since 2009. These improved results signal just how far the NOPD has come since the dark days of the 2000s. Back then, the force was engulfed by scandal. Criminality and misconduct were rife. ""If you take almost every major federal felony that we have in law, except for possibly treason, we've had a New Orleans police officer who has been arrested, convicted, prosecuted and sued for those acts,"" Mary Howell, a New Orleans-based civil rights lawyer, told the BBC. Ms Howell has devoted much of her 40-year career to pursuing justice for the victims of these acts. One of the most troubling incidents, she recalled, happened in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. That year, New Orleans officers shot six people on the city's Danziger Bridge, killing two. All of the victims were African Americans. None were armed, nor had they committed any crimes. Eleven officers ultimately pleaded guilty to charges related to the shootings, and an attempt to cover them up. Ms Howell said she was dismayed by this and other similar incidents, which happened time and again in New Orleans. The violence, she said, came in cycles. ""You see the same patterns with domestic violence,"" Ms Howell said. ""There would be a terrible incident, and then there would be the candy, and the flowers, and 'I am so sorry'. Then it would happen again."" At its nadir in 2012, the NOPD was brought under federal supervision. Known as a consent decree, the supervision order required the force to undertake sweeping reforms. The use of force, stops, searches, seizures and arrests; everything was revised to rebuild trust and improve public safety. A new training regime was a key component of that change. That training was where Ms Howell and Dr Staub came in. Ms Howell first stumbled across Dr Staub's work in the 1990s. The lawyer read a New York Times article in which Dr Staub talked about a training programme he had designed for police forces in California. The training programme was commissioned after the beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police officers in 1991. Dr Staub said he saw ""no sign of this training"", despite assurances it would be implemented. Nevertheless, Ms Howell was convinced Dr Staub was on to something. For his theories on harm prevention, Dr Staub was seen as a cult figure in police-reform circles. Years later, sensing an opportunity to spur change in New Orleans, Ms Howell revisited Dr Staub's concept of ethical policing. Maybe this could work in the city, she thought. At Ms Howell's suggestion, the NOPD developed a peer-intervention training programme. EPIC was the outcome. When the consent decree came into effect in New Orleans, Jonathan Aronie was one of the lawyers appointed to monitor its progress. He was impressed by EPIC, mainly because it was aimed at all officers, not just a ""small number of wrongdoers"". ""This was a programme for the high percentage of people in the world, and in the police department, that want to do the right thing,"" Mr Aronie said. ""They would want to prevent harm, if they only had a skill to do it."" A new national initiative, launched after Mr Floyd's death, seeks to give officers that skill. The Active Bystandership for Law Enforcement (ABLE) project will offer support to police departments across the country in developing their own peer-intervention training programmes. Built on the principles of EPIC, ABLE training, technical assistance and research will be provided, free of charge. An initial $400,000 (£307,000) has been raised to fund the project, led by Georgetown University and law firm Sheppard Mullin. With demand for police reform growing, ABLE organisers are hoping more funding will follow. ""After the George Floyd killing we probably received 100 calls from police departments wanting EPIC training,"" said Mr Aronie, chair of ABLE's board of advisers. By October, 34 police departments in Boston, Denver, Philadelphia and other cities will have undertaken a ""training of trainers"" for the ABLE programme. To qualify for the training, each agency had to commit to ABLE's standards and submit letters of support from prominent community organisations. On its own, this training does not represent a panacea for police misbehaviour, Mr Aronie said. It needs to be part of a broader cultural transformation in policing that goes beyond ""pimping the programme for publicity"", he said. Still, Dr Staub's ideas are becoming the foundation of that transformation. EPIC ""could have changed the whole dynamic"" of Mr Floyd's fatal arrest, Dr Staub said. Had they received the training, the three officers who watched on ""would have felt empowered"" to intervene. They, just like Ms Gogan and the diplomat who took risks for Dr Staub, could have stepped in to challenge the actions of one, with the combined will of three. ""Individuals can make a huge difference,"" Dr Staub said. ""They have great power, and when they join together, they have substantial power."" BBC World Service radio talked to Dr Staub about his role in transforming policing in the US for its latest episode of People Fixing the World. You can listen to the podcast on BBC Sounds from 6 October.

"input: The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) advice for England and Wales says older people may face more frequent attacks because they are less independent. It makes clear abuse may not always involve violence - warning that young people my face abuse via mobile phones and social media. The advice will be consulted on before coming into force. 'Partner violence' The CPS points out that people's experiences of domestic abuse change as they get older. It says the intensity of abuse may be greater among pensioners because they may feel less able to escape or to get help as they are dependent on their abuser. Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Alison Saunders said: ""We know from research conducted by others that there is very little evidence that partner violence decreases with age. ""And it is important we also recognise the factors that may contribute to and impact upon domestic abuse between older people."" The new guidance, which is intended to help prosecutors in England and Wales decide when to bring charges against perpetrators of domestic abuse, is yet to come into force. The issue of elderly abuse was brought into the spotlight following the death of 81-year-old Mary Russell. She was abused by her husband and died following a ""domestic-related"" incident in 2010, suffering a bleed to the brain. The pensioner, of Leigh-on-Sea in Essex, had made eight 999 calls in the seven months before her death. Exclusion and isolation She made her first report to police in 2003 after she was found standing on her doorstep with a bloody nose. Albert Russell, 88, the victim's husband, was arrested following her death, but it was decided there was insufficient evidence to prosecute him. He has since died. The draft guidance claims that growing older can lead to exclusion or isolation, which may make a victim more vulnerable to domestic abuse. For younger victims, prosecutors are advised to consider abusive relationships which form part of the membership of a gang. Some victims may be coerced into sexual activity in return for protection or status, according to the guidance. It advises prosecutors to ask police about a victim's family life to determine whether telling their parents about any potential prosecution might affect their safety. 'Honey traps' Consideration should be given to bail restrictions and restraining orders, the code also says, and prosecutors should take into account areas which victims often visit, like school or social clubs, and methods of contact, such as social media. The guidance also advises prosecutors on abusive relationships within gangs, highlighting the fact that some victims may be coerced into sex in return for protection or status. ""Some teenagers may not consider themselves victims of domestic violence, especially if they are not being physically abused but are being targeted on social media for example,"" Ms Saunders added. ""Similarly, abuse in gang environments - for example young girls being forced into sexual activity as part of gang initiation or used as 'honey traps' to set up rival gang members - is often not reported. ""Understandably, a lot of my prosecutors will not be familiar with the workings of gang culture or gang slang so I have included it in the proposed guidance so that they know what to look for when considering such cases.""

"input: It said it had ""received information of possible threats"" at city locations where Western nationals gather. Uganda's government said the US had warned of a possible suicide bomber trying to enter the country. Uganda was under threat because its troops were fighting militant Islamists in Somalia, a spokesman added. In 2010, Somalia's al-Shabab militants carried out a suicide bombing in Kampala, killing 76 people as they watched the football World Cup final. The US embassy said an attack ""may take place soon"". Some planned events had been cancelled at Kampala hotels, it added. Border controls have been tightened to stop the suspected suicide bomber and his accomplices from crossing into Uganda, government spokesman Ofwono Opondo told the BBC. Uganda is a key contributor to the African Union mission fighting al-Shabab inside Somalia. Last September, Uganda was stripped of the right to host an international cricket tournament because of security concerns.

"input: By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Although several cancers are caused by infections, Cancer Research UK says it is too early to add prostate cancer to this list. The University of California scientists tested human prostate cells in the lab. They found a sex infection called trichomoniasis aided cancer growth. More research is now needed to confirm the link, they say in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Sex infection Trichomoniasis is believed to infect some 275 million people worldwide and is the most common non-viral sexually transmitted infection. Often, a person will have no symptoms and be unaware that they have it. Men may feel itching or irritation inside the penis, burning after urination or ejaculation, or a white discharge from the penis. Women may notice itching or soreness of the genitals, discomfort with urination, or a discharge with an unpleasant fishy smell. This latest research is not the first to suggest a link between trichomoniasis and prostate cancer. A study in 2009 found a quarter of men with prostate cancer showed signs of trichomoniasis, and these men were more likely to have advanced tumours. The PNAS study suggests how the sexually transmitted infection might make men more vulnerable to prostate cancer, although it is not definitive proof of such a link. Prof Patricia Johnson and colleagues found the parasite that causes trichomoniasis - Trichomonas vaginalis - secretes a protein that causes inflammation and increased growth and invasion of benign and cancerous prostate cells. They say more studies should now follow to further explore this finding - particularly since we still do not know what causes prostate cancer. Nicola Smith, health information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: ""This study suggests a possible way the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis could encourage prostate cancer cells to grow and develop more quickly. ""But the research was only done in the lab, and previous evidence in patients failed to show a clear link between prostate cancer and this common sexually transmitted infection. ""There's been a lot of research into prostate cancer risk and we're working hard to piece together the puzzle. ""But there are still no known lifestyle factors that seem to affect the risk of developing the disease - and no convincing evidence for a link with infection. ""The risk of prostate cancer is known to increase with age."" Prostate cancer is now the most common cancer in men in the UK - about one in nine men will get it at some point in their lives. It is more common in men over 70, and there appears to be some genetic risk since the disease can run in families.

"input: Preston Crown Court heard the remark by David Duckenfield was overheard by Glen Kirton, the Football Association's head of media relations at the time in 1989. He also said the former chief superintendent said it had ""caused casualties"". Mr Duckenfield, 74, denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 fans. The former South Yorkshire Police chief superintendent, of Ferndown in Dorset, was the match commander at the FA Cup semi-final on 15 April 1989. Sheffield Wednesday's ex-club secretary Graham Mackrell, 69, denies a charge related to the stadium safety certificate and a health and safety charge. The semi-final match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest was stopped after six minutes when overcrowding on the terraces caused a fatal crush. Mr Kirton told the court shortly after the game was halted he went with FA chief executive Graham Kelly to the police control box to find out what was happening. He told the court it was clear from the control box that a lot of people were injured on the pitch, but that they were mainly receiving treatment from supporters themselves. Asked if there appeared to be any central organisation, he replied: ""As a layman, I thought what was going on on the pitch looked chaotic."" Mr Kirton said he also remembered Mr Duckenfield stating that in his view the match should be abandoned altogether but that he did not want to make the announcement at that point as ""he had a lot of angry people and it could cause disturbances"". The jury has previously been told the match commander ordered the opening of an exit gate. They have also heard that more than 2,000 fans went through gate C when it was opened by the police. Ben Myers QC, representing Mr Duckenfield, asked Mr Kirton if he could remember which gate Mr Duckenfield was referring to and at what time. Mr Kirton said he could not. Mr Duckenfield denies causing the deaths of 95 people who died as a result of the crush at Hillsborough. Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the 96th victim, Tony Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after the disaster. The trial continues.

"input: The Scottish Chambers of Commerce (SCC) found confidence was ""buoyant"" in manufacturing and construction as orders rose in the second quarter. Almost 70% of firms in financial and business services said they expected profits to increase over the next year. But SCC said Scottish firms were finding it hard to find the skilled staff required to maintain growth. The findings were included in SCC's latest quarterly business survey, released in conjunction with the University of Strathclyde's Fraser of Allander Institute. It looked at six of Scotland's key sectors - construction, financial and business services, manufacturing, retail, tourism and wholesale. Manufacturers reported an increase in exporting for the sixth consecutive quarter, while investment plans in the sector were at their highest level since the end of 2007. More than half of construction respondents reported a rise in total new contracts, with fewer than 15% reporting a decline. The upward trend was forecast to continue, with a net 30% of firms expecting a rise in the third quarter. However, there was an unexpected fall in public sector orders, which is anticipated to continue. Confidence, visitor numbers and employment levels among hotels remained high and were expected to increase further in the third quarter of this year. The survey also found sales improved for retailers between the first and second quarter of this year and were higher than any previous second quarter in the last seven years. There was also an increase in expenditure on capital and training investment by businesses in the financial and business services sector. Meanwhile, employment trends remained ""buoyant"", with at least 80% of businesses looking at either retaining or increasing their employee numbers. Rapid jobs growth was expected from the construction sector. 'Right track' SCC chief executive Liz Cameron said: ""The majority of sectors are experiencing continued growth with key indicators maintained from the last quarter, showing that business is on the right track. ""Employment is a key measurement of business mood and our findings show that, with increased growth and confidence, businesses are now moving away from employing temporary staff towards new permanent full-time positions. ""This is good news for everyone providing employees and business with a level of stability."" She added: ""Skills shortages existent in the workforce are making it difficult for business to source and employ the skilled staff required to maintain this growth. ""Our continued failure to address these issues will block the ability of business to continue on this path. ""The positive results from business should act as motivation for swift action. ""Colleges, universities, government, with business at the core and in the driving seat, need to develop and implement a realistic plan to plug these gaps urgently."" The Scottish government said investing in Scotland's workforce was key to the country's future economic success. A spokesperson added: ""Scottish business confidence remains buoyant, with encouraging trends across key sectors in new business, investment intentions and expectations for output, turnover and profitability. ""These figures show that the Scottish economy is strengthening.""

"input: By Paul BurnellBBC News In a cafe in Sloane Square, the screenwriter and Conservative peer Julian Fellowes is contemplating his most notorious ancestor. The creator of the hit ITV drama Downton Abbey is considering how, as a screenwriter used to drawing dramatic characters, he would assess the personality of William Hulton. ""Most characters have shades of grey because, on the whole, I think that in life people don't tend to be all evil or all good,"" Fellowes says. ""But actually William Hulton was pushing it for 'all evil'... I don't think he had much to redeem him."" The Oscar-winning writer is Hulton's great-great-great grandson - but this is not a source of pride. He was, he says, a ""cruel and horrible man"". It was Hulton who, as a magistrate in north-west England, gave the notorious order for troops to violently disperse a peaceful, pro-democracy protest in the centre of the UK's first industrial city. Screenwriters make much of a character's motives, so what does Fellowes think drove Hulton, who was born into a family of wealthy landowners? ""He was clearly a sort of hysteric,"" he says. ""He was clearly terrified of any overthrow of the established social order."" Two hundred years ago, working-class people in Manchester and other industrial towns in the north of England were becoming increasingly vocal in their demands for political reform. They were angry about the fact that most of the population could not vote, that corruption was rife, and that urban areas were grossly underrepresented in Parliament. At least 50,000 people arrived at St Peter's Fields on 16 August 1819 to hear radical speaker Henry Hunt campaign for parliamentary reform. At this time, Manchester had no police force so the Manchester Yeomanry was sent in to prevent any disturbances. When Hunt began to speak the army tried to arrest him, and attacked anybody who got in its way. At least 11 people were killed and 400 injured. The events soon became notorious in the press, where they were dubbed Peterloo, an ironic reference to the Battle of Waterloo that had taken place four years previously. ""It was only the barest of beginnings for any kind of workers' movement,"" says Fellowes. ""But Hulton immediately went into some kind of overdrive, attacking a group that included a group of many women and many children - a lot of whom hadn't done anything."" He describes Hulton's heavy-handed response as a total misreading of the situation. ""Instead of lining up across the field and reading some sort of 'go home!' message, which clearly would have been the reasonable thing to do, he sent the yeomanry to a crowd who could not at once disperse. ""They were seen by him to be resisting but they were unarmed - they weren't resisting them with weapons."" The film Peterloo, which goes on general release on 2 November, is directed by Salford-born Mike Leigh, who is known for his gritty tales of working-class life. ""Although I don't think Mike Leigh and I are as one politically... I certainly agree with him about who were the bad guys,"" said Fellowes. Seven years before Peterloo, as a justice of the peace, Hulton had already sentenced four Luddites to death for setting fire to a weaving mill in Westhoughton, near Bolton. One of those hanged was a 12-year-old boy. While history is full of monsters, historians tend to temper criticism when actions are in keeping with the standards of the time. But, in Hulton's case, even this does not save his reputation. ""They thought it was cruel and unnecessary and inhuman,"" Fellowes says. ""And so, in a sense, he was already an offender before the demonstration at St Peter's Field had ever happened. ""I feel extremely sorry for the men, women and children who were cut down at Peterloo. ""I think they were doing no more than making clear to those who would listen - the writing was on the wall, workers were bound to have some rights. ""What people like Hulton were trying to do was to fight history, and to fight the inevitable."" Among those on the receiving end of the cavalry charge was Mary Heys, who was pregnant with her sixth child. She had joined the hordes gathered near her ramshackle home in Oxford Street, which nearly two centuries later is occupied by a McDonald's restaurant. Heys's story has been researched by her five times great-granddaughter Denise Southworth. The 57-year-old said Heys was one of the massacre's ""forgotten victims"". Indeed, estimates of the final death toll vary widely and the true number will never be known. ""She was trampled by a horse,"" said Ms Southworth. ""Why would a woman in her 40s who was pregnant want to take part in a riot?"" The day after Heys was injured, she began having fits. Four months later she gave birth to a premature baby, Henry. ""[Mary] died just before Christmas - because she didn't die straight away, she wasn't counted among the dead,"" said Ms Southworth, who is Manchester born and bred. ""We gave more significance in my school in Manchester to the Battle of Waterloo than to Peterloo. ""I think it has been overlooked even in Manchester. ""I knew nothing about it - in my history books they were too busy talking about Napoleon and Waterloo."" Ms Southworth's sense of outrage has prompted her to join the Peterloo Memorial Campaign, which has the backing of Peterloo star Maxine Peake. It is fighting for a permanent memorial to those who died, rather than just the small plaque which currently sits on the wall of the Radisson Hotel. Ms Southworth said: ""You look round here - the middle of Manchester - and see all these beautiful, fabulous, glass, expensive buildings - do people know what happened here 200 years ago? ""Do they know about how the ordinary working people came for a peaceful demonstration and were butchered? ""We are always told about Manchester's achievements, but let's not forget the spot where people were killed for trying get a decent standard of living. ""We owe it as educated people to remember those who didn't have a vote and did not have any rights.""

"input: Onasi Olio-Rojas, 20, was filming himself while weaving in and out of traffic on US Route 6 in Providence, Rhode Island, when he lost control of his car on Wednesday. He was seriously injured after hitting a rubbish truck which was pulling onto the road and crossed three lanes before hitting a concrete barrier. Police say they're considering bringing charges against him. ""It's a grand slam of things not to do,"" Captain John Allen of the Rhode Island State Police told NBC 10 WJAR. ""Phone in your hand. No seat belt. Travelling at a high rate of speed. In and out of traffic. ""Some of the speeds you see on that video are incredible. [He's] clearly way out of control."" This is what Onasi Olio-Rojas' car looked like after the crash. Providence firefighters also posted this photo on Twitter. Police say Onasi Olio-Rojas was driving with a suspended licence at the time of the accident and he's had two previous accidents this year. He was taken to hospital in February with minor injuries after a crash with another driver and was pulled over in May for driving on the hard shoulder, aggressive driving and texting while driving. Officers say they're still investigating this latest case and they may bring charges of reckless driving, speeding and driving with a suspended licence. The crash also caused hours of delays as emergency services cut the 20-year-old out of his car. The truck driver wasn't hurt. It appears that Facebook has taken down Onasi Olio-Rojas' account.

"input: Sir Maurice was the designer and creator of Edsac, a computer that ran its first program in May 1949. The Cambridge machine was the first widely-useable stored program machine and was very influential on the nascent British computer industry. It set standards for how computers should be used in academia and business that have lasted until the present day. Following work on developing radar during World War II, Sir Maurice returned to Cambridge to begin designing the machine that would become Edsac. Prior to the war he had studied mathematics at Cambridge and been heavily involved with the rather limited calculating machines used in the department. Study of the design documents for what would become the US Edvac machine convinced him that computers were the future and he started the project to build one at Cambridge. His efforts were helped by a trip to the US to attend a series of lectures, known as the Moore School, run by the American scientists who had built the pioneering Eniac computer and were working on its successor Edvac. ""Maurice Wilkes was the first to turn these ideas into a fully-functional electronic stored-program computer when the Cambridge Edsac ran its first program in May 1949,"" said computer historian Professor Simon Lavington. Unlike earlier machines such as the Manchester Mark I which were largely experimental, Sir Maurice wanted to put his computer to practical use. ""The Edsac group was the most influential of the early British computing teams,"" said Prof Lavington, ""most especially in setting high standards for the development of software and the organisation of a computing service to scientists and engineers."" The success of Edsac caught the attention of catering firm J Lyons which funded further development of the machine and led to the creation of the Leo - one of the first machines put to dedicated business use. Innovations at the Cambridge computer laboratory, such as microprogramming and time-sharing, were widely influential in the industry at large. ""If any person deserves the title of the father of British computing, it is surely Professor Sir Maurice Wilkes,"" said Prof Lavington.

"input: By Andreas IllmerBBC News The situation is not looking great in Japan. A coronavirus state of emergency has been extended in the capital Tokyo and three other major prefectures as cases continue to rise. Yet there's been no word about cancelling the Games, despite both health experts and public opinion being stacked against them. Current polls in Japan show nearly 70% of the population do not want the Olympics to go ahead, but the International Olympic Committee (IOC) remains steadfast that the spectacle will take place. Japan has long insisted there was no question the Olympics, which should have taken place last summer, would be held and will be safe. Yet earlier this week, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga for the first time appeared to bow to the pressure of public opinion, saying that the government would ""not put the Olympics first"" - but adding that ultimately, the decision would lie with the IOC. So who actually wields the power to cancel the Games - and is a cancellation likely to happen? How could the Games be axed? The contract between the IOC and host city Tokyo is straightforward: There's one article regarding cancellation and it only gives the option for the IOC to cancel, not for the host city. That's because the Olympic Games are the ""exclusive property"" of the IOC, international sports lawyer Alexandre Miguel Mestre told the BBC. And as the ""owner"" of the Games, it is the IOC that can terminate said contract. One reason given to justify a cancellation - aside from things like war or civil disorder - is that if ""the IOC has reasonable grounds to believe, in its sole discretion, that the safety of participants in the Games would be seriously threatened or jeopardised for any reason whatsoever"". Arguably, the pandemic could be seen as such a threat. The Olympic charter also stipulates that the IOC should ensure ""the health of the athletes"" and promote ""safe sports"", Mr Mestre says, but despite all this, the IOC seems determined to go ahead. So could Japan go against the IOC and pull out itself? ""Under various clauses within this host city agreement, if Japan was to unilaterally cancel the contract, then by and large, the risks and losses would fall with the local organising committee,"" Professor Jack Anderson at the University of Melbourne told the BBC. The sports law expert explains that the contract is fairly typical and that of course Tokyo knew what it signed up to. What it didn't know was that a global pandemic would enter the picture. ""Contracts can foresee certain contingencies, but the nature of the current situation is obviously unprecedented,"" he says. ""The Olympics are the biggest sporting event on the calendar, there are billions at stake for Japan and also the IOC in terms of broadcasting sponsorship. It is a huge event and there are huge contractual obligations for all sides."" Hence, the only realistic scenario is Japan pulling the plug jointly with the IOC, staying within the framework of their contract. If that happens, that's where insurances would come in: The IOC has insurance, the local organising committee has insurance and the various broadcasters and sponsors will also have insurance. ""It's probably safe to say that if the Tokyo Olympics is cancelled, it would probably be the biggest insurance pay-out event of its kind, there's no question about that,"" Prof Anderson says. Insurance would cover the concrete expenses by the organisers, but it would hardly cover all of the indirect cost raked up by investments across the country in anticipation of the spectacle - hotels and restaurants for example, that might have undergone renovations in preparations for tourists they thought they would receive. A chorus of criticism As of now, the uncertainty around the Games lingers on. It's been a rocky road - they were postponed from last year, the torch run got interrupted again and again, international fans won't be allowed to come and now even competitions in completely empty stadiums are on the cards. Few athletes have spoken out about the issue and they are likely torn over the issue. For those who make it, the Olympics are among the highlights of their career and what they have trained for for years. At the same time, there's the concern for personal and public health in the middle of a global pandemic. Japan's biggest sports star, tennis champion Naomi Osaka was one of the few to join the debate, but also only voicing cautious hesitation. ""Of course I want the Olympics to happen,"" she said this week. ""But I think there's so much important stuff going on, especially the past year. ""For me, I feel like if it's putting people at risk... then it definitely should be a discussion, which I think it is as of right now. At the end of the day, I'm just an athlete, and there is a whole pandemic going on."" The US' track and field team earlier this week cancelled its pre-Olympics training camp in Japan out of safety concerns. And even the governor of the province that would have hosted the team, said he believed ""they made the best decision possible in the current situation"". The same uncertainty trickles through from many of those involved in organising the Games. Several of the towns who were set to host the athletes across the Tokyo region have reportedly pulled out for fear the programme might add to the spread of Covid. One local governor this week said he had rejected requests to secure hospital beds for the athletes. Instead, he urged that a new postponement or possibly cancellation should at least be considered. A doctors union this week said in a statement to the government that it was ""impossible"" to hold the Games given the development of the pandemic. Few of these things are clear-cut calls for the Games to be cancelled, but with the warnings by health experts and public opinion turning against the games, the trickle of doubters is becoming a steady chorus over the past weeks. More than just money There is more at stake though than just the financial cost of cancelling the Olympics. The next Games on the global calendar are already next year, the Winter Games in February 2022, hosted by regional rival China in Beijing. So there is little doubt that overall, Japan is prepared to go to great lengths to get the Tokyo Games done. The last time Japan hosted a Summer Olympics was in 1964 and at the time, they were seen as an important symbol for the country's rehabilitation and rebuilding process after World War Two. For the Tokyo 2020/21 Games, there's again a symbolic significance, Prof Anderson explains. ""Japan has seen economic stagnation for a long time, there has been the tsunami and the nuclear disaster of Fukushima, so the Games would been as symbolic of a revival of Japan,"" he says. ""It does take a special importance in that sense."" Ultimately, the question of whether the Games should go ahead is separate from whether they will go ahead. In the history of the modern Olympics, there have been only three instances the spectacle got cancelled: in 1916, 1940 and 1944 - all three cases due to the two World Wars. So despite mounting headwinds, the IOC's refusal to even consider a cancellation has most observers agreeing that this year's Olympics will indeed go ahead and kick off on 23 July - in what shape or form still remains unclear.

"input: By Lamia EstatieBBC News The outdoor gathering for residents was organised by the Syrian Adaleh Foundation, founded in 2012 to aid affected areas in rebel-held Eastern Ghouta. The group meals will run for the duration of the last 10 days of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. ""We would have normally been cautious to host such events due to air strikes, but we are taking advantage of the latest de-escalation deal,"" an official from the humanitarian foundation's Turkey bureau told the BBC. Food prices in Syria are hugely inflated due to the conflict. The food for the Iftar - the meal when Muslims end their daily fast during Ramadan - was prepared in other parts of Eastern Ghouta and brought into Douma, which has been besieged for four years, the official said. Last month, an aid convoy entered the town for the first time since October 2016. The rebel-held suburb of Douma is controlled by the rebel group Jaysh al-Islam, and has repeatedly been attacked by Syrian government forces with air strikes and barrel bombs in the last few years. One resident of the town who attended the mass Iftar said several hundred people were present and that they previously would have had such meals ""hidden in mosques, fearing strikes"". ""I don't know how emotionally confused I would be if I were in the shoes of anyone inside, "" said a Syrian medical technologist who tweeted the photos, calling the scene ""Life despite death today in Douma."" You might also like: One Twitter user dubbed the meal an ""Iftar of heroes"". ""Despite the difficult circumstances, these people hang on to life and teach lessons in perseverance,"" another added. Prominent Syrian journalists, including Turkey-based Hadi Abdallah and London-based Mousa al-Omar wished good health to those breaking fast, sharing the images which gained thousands of reactions online.

"input: By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter Norwich Theatre Royal became one of the first to call off its pantomime this week, saying the risk was ""too great"" after three months with no income. Venues in Buxton and Welwyn Garden City have also cancelled, while Leicester Curve has scrapped its festive musical. Pantos are crucial to theatre earnings, and this Christmas could prove to be make or break for some venues' futures. Conservative MP Giles Watling, a former actor and panto dame, warned of the impact if festive shows are scrapped. ""I think many provincial theatres will go to the wall, frankly, because that's the time they can make the money,"" he told BBC News. ""It puts money in the coffers to support the rest of the cultural offer. I can see massive problems ahead if something isn't done and soon."" Theatres have been shut since March because of the coronavirus pandemic, and the government hasn't given a date for the return of live performances. The UK's biggest pantomime producer Qdos has set a deadline of 3 August to decide whether its 34 shows - in cities from Bristol to Birmingham and Bradford - can go ahead. Qdos managing director Michael Harrison told BBC News there could be ""a lot of redundancies"" in regional theatres if Aladdin, Snow White and Dick Whittington fall victim to live entertainment's extended lockdown. ""If Christmas is cancelled - or if pantomime is cancelled - then the theatres will be left with no choice,"" he said. ""And I'm afraid that if it gets to 3 August and we haven't got clarity from the government, we will then have to begin the process of unravelling the season."" He wants an official date for the theatres to reopen, but said pantos will only be able to go ahead if social distancing is put behind us. ""Commercial theatre can't operate on anything less than 100% capacity. It's no good saying you can sell every other row,"" he said. ""How can you social distance actors on stage? How can you social distance dancers who have to touch each other? How do you social distance somebody who has to do a quick costume change? There's all of those things to take into consideration. ""We can adapt if we have some clarity about what the position might be. But we do need to know in advance to set those ideas and plans in motion."" Although social distancing in the audience may make shows unviable, The Elgiva theatre in Chesham, Buckinghamshire, recently switched from Snow White to Sleeping Beauty to reduce the number of performers backstage. Manager David Cooper said: ""Sleeping Beauty means fewer people backstage, as there won't be any dwarfs, so we can ensure the cast has the proper social distancing."" Last week, the government published a five-step roadmap for restarting live performance, but were widely criticised for not attaching a timetable or financial support. Earlier this month, Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, told MPs that Christmas shows were economically ""vital"" for theatres. He said: ""It is the time when theatres, being blunt, make the most profit, and that profit they need for the rest of the year to invest in everything they do and all the other types of productions."" John Barrowman, who is due to star in Snow White at Bristol Hippodrome this winter, told ITV's Good Morning Britain that if Christmas shows are scrapped, ""70% of theatres around the UK are going to be gone"". 'Fade into dust' Not all theatres stage traditional pantos - seasonal musicals are also under threat. Last week, Leicester Curve called off The Wizard of Oz, saying such productions ""take months of preparation"". In the US, Broadway theatres have confirmed they will stay shut until 2021. On Wednesday, Norwich Theatre, which runs the city's Theatre Royal, Playhouse and Stage Two, announced that 113 of its 217 jobs are at risk, with a further 59 employees on zero hours contracts told they won't get any more work. Chief executive Stephen Crocker said: ""I remain shocked and angry that the government is standing idle as an industry that has delivered so much to this country and is so vital to its recovery is being allowed to fade into dust."" 'A pack of cards' Mr Watling, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Theatre, has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson pointing out how vital theatres are, ""not just for the arts offer, but for UK plc"". He said: ""I used to tour the world, taking the theatre to every corner of the world, and we are highly regarded because of our massive and very important theatre offer."" A government spokesperson said: ""We are clear that we want to get the performing arts fully back up and running safely as soon as possible and are working closely with the sector on a phased approach, guided by public health and medical experts."" They said the government was also ""considering ways in which we may be able to support"" the theatre industry on top of the ""unprecedented financial assistance"" from the loans, grants and furlough scheme open to businesses, plus a £160m Arts Council England emergency package. Mr Watling called for more information and help before more theatres are forced to cancel Christmas. He said: ""Theatre Royal Norwich losing its pantomime is indicative of the way the whole thing could go like a pack of cards."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

"input: Police said 30-year old Farzana Parveen died on the spot after being attacked with bricks and sticks. Her father handed himself in, but police say her brothers and former fiance, who also took part in the attack, were still free. Correspondents say hundreds of girls and women in Pakistan are killed every year by family members. However, many more killings are believed to go unreported. Farzana Parveen's parents accused her husband, Muhammad Iqbal, of kidnapping her, and had filed a case against him at the High Court. However, she testified to police that she had married him of her own accord. Police said the couple had been engaged for a number of years. As she arrived at the court building for a hearing, police said about a dozen family members pulled her aside and began to attack her and her husband, who managed to escape. Police official Umer Cheema told Reuters that all the family members escaped after the killing, apart from her father, who has admitted his role in her death. The BBC's Shumaila Jaffery says marriage against the wishes of relatives is culturally unacceptable in some parts of Pakistan. Under Pakistani law, the victim's family is allowed to forgive the killer. However, in many cases family members are themselves responsible for the killing.

"input: Raphaël André, 51, was pronounced dead early on Sunday after being discovered in a portable toilet next to a centre he had stayed at the day before. The Open Door shelter, normally open 24 hours, had been forced to close by Montreal health officials. Advocates for the homeless say Mr André may have frozen to death. The cause of death has not been confirmed by officials. A friend discovered his body at around 03:00 EST (08:00 GMT) on Sunday. Police have determined Mr André's death was not criminal and have turned the investigation over to the coroner. Mr André was a member of the Innu nation, initially from the Matimekush-Lac John community in northern Quebec, according to CBC News. He was a regular at the Open Door shelter, a drop-in centre in central Montreal that provides services to unhoused people, staff told Canadian media. He had stopped by for a meal and a shower on Saturday night and had been seen that day building snowmen nearby. Montreal temperatures dropped below freezing on Saturday evening into Sunday morning. Open Door executive director Mélodie Racine told CBC that the province's health agency had forced the shelter to close its doors at 21:30 local time on Sunday following a Covid-19 outbreak. ""He didn't die for one reason,"" Ms Racine said. ""There are a lot of factors in place. But what I know is that if he was not asked to leave, he would have probably stayed inside."" Montreal public health officials said in a statement it recommended Open Door be reopened once the outbreak was contained, and Mayor Valérie Plante said the city would work with public agencies to keep the shelter open through the night. The shelter did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC.

"input: Since his appointment was announced in April, Mr Harding, 43, has spent time with the corporation's news teams to familiarise himself. He said in July that he wanted ""an ambitious BBC"" not ""an apologetic BBC"". Mr Harding is also the Times's former business editor and was Washington bureau chief for the Financial Times. He is taking on the BBC job following criticisms of its handling of two Newsnight crises - one over the failure to broadcast an investigation into sex abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile and a subsequent programme that led to former Conservative Party treasurer Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated in claims of child abuse. Mr Harding said at the Journalists' Charity annual lunch in July that the BBC had made its ""fair share"" of apologies, but that licence fee payers did not want an apologetic national broadcaster. His appointment was hailed by BBC director general Tony Hall in April, who said: ""High quality journalism is at the heart of our organisation. ""I believe James will give News a renewed sense of purpose as it moves on from what has been an undeniably difficult chapter."" The director general added that Mr Harding would bring ""the benefit of his external perspective and experience to the senior executive team and wider organisation"". Mr Harding, who will receive a salary of £340,000, said he was ""honoured"" to be a part of the BBC's newsroom that is ""trusted for its accuracy, respected for its fairness and admired for the courage of its reporting"". Early career His predecessor, Helen Boaden, moved to a new role as director of BBC Radio in March. Ms Boaden had to step aside for a period from November last year, along with her deputy Steve Mitchell, in the wake of the Savile investigations. She returned to her job just before Christmas, after the Pollard Review criticised BBC management but found no evidence of a cover-up over the shelving of an investigation into Savile by Newsnight. At the same time Mr Mitchell's resignation was accepted by the BBC. Mr Harding began his career at the Financial Times in 1994 where he opened a bureau in Shanghai. He was the FT's media editor for three years and went on to become Washington bureau chief in 2002. He joined the Times in 2006 as business editor before being appointed editor of the paper in 2007. He resigned last December, saying it had been made clear that publishers News International wanted a new editor. During the Leveson Inquiry examining the culture, practice and ethics of the press, he publicly apologised for a Times reporter who allegedly hacked into Lancashire police detective Richard Horton's email account to write a story. When Mr Harding resigned in 2012, the chairman and chief executive of News Corp Rupert Murdoch called him ""a distinguished editor"" who had led the paper through ""difficult times"".

"input: The Birmingham-based 2 Sisters Food Group said the purchase of VION would help the company meet growing demand. About 300 jobs in Llangefni, 1,300 in Sandycroft, Flintshire, and 1,300 in Merthyr have been safeguarded by the deal. But it does not include Welsh Country Foods on Anglesey which is up for sale. The Dutch food group VION announced in November that it was selling its operations in Britain. The 2 Sisters Food Group, which is owned by Boparan Holdings Limited (BHL), said the move would secure the future of 11 sites across the UK and the jobs of 6,000 employees, while helping the firm meet growing demand and the allow expansion into the red meat industry. Viable future Ranjit Singh, chief executive of 2 Sisters Food Group, said: ""We are delighted to be acquiring VION UK's poultry and red meat businesses. ""They have faced significant uncertainty and tough trading in recent months, but today's acquisition secures a viable future. ""With the majority of the operations being in Scotland and Wales, we are delighted that the Scottish and Welsh governments are supportive of this deal and we look forward to working with them and developing a sustainable future for these businesses."" Anglesey council leader Brian Owen said he was hoping for a meeting as soon as possible with the company to see how they see their future in Llangefni.

'Excellent news' ""We are still in talks with the company, the government and workers to see if there is hope in Gaerwen,"" he added. Huw Lewis, the Labour AM for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, said VION's announcement that it planned to sell its UK operations had ""caused a great deal of worry to workers and their families at St Merryn Foods. ""I wholeheartedly welcome today's announcement by 2 Sisters Food Group and the safeguarding of jobs here in Merthyr Tydfil,"" he added. Business Minister Edwina Hart said: ""We have been working closely with both Vion and 2 Sisters to help secure this deal in order to sustain the future for the workers and the supply chain in Wales."" Red meat promotion agency Hybu Cig Cymru (HCC) has also welcomed the news. ""This is excellent news for Merthyr, not only for the town and the employees who are directly employed at St Merryn, but also for the hundreds of farmers who supply the plant,"" said HCC chairman Dai Davies. ""Despite being left out of today's deal, HCC remains hopeful that there is a future for Welsh Country Foods (at Gaerwen). ""As the last remaining large abattoir in north Wales it has an important strategic role to play in the red meat industry of the region,"" he added.

Director Richard Lanyon said: ""The plans, as submitted, remain the only viable option - without the mix of uses we've identified, it'll remain empty.""

"input: By Martina PurdyBBC News NI Political Correspondent On the east bank there is a largely unionist population, and on the west, a solidly nationalist and Catholic one, with significant sections of unionists in the north and south. There is another difference. The Catholic population is young with the number rising to 49%. The Protestant population is older and passing away and has dropped to 42%. Others such as new immigrants or those from mixed relationships with no fixed religion make up the rest. Belfast is at a tipping point, according to the author of a new peace report, Dr Paul Nolan. He underscores the connection between that shifting population and the flags row in Belfast. He said Belfast changed over the past decade from being a majority unionist city to a city where the largest group is Catholic. He said these figures from the 2011 census were finally published a week after the row erupted in Belfast City Council over the decision to restrict the flying of the union flag to designated days only. 'Human sensors' He said those protestors did not read the report, but they acted out of its realities. ""Sometimes people can act like human sensors. They pick up what is happening underneath their feet. That earthquake that was happening,"" he said. That earthquake is one of the themes of peace monitoring report. It also describes young Protestant men, a quarter of whom are jobless, as a seedbed for trouble. This is because of alienation and the risk of being drawn into a cultural conflict. Loyalist community worker, Gerald Solinas, who also represents the Ulster Political Research Group, is critical of the report. He dislikes the language and claims its conclusions are too simplistic. He thinks words such as ""tipping point"" are dangerous. He points out that nationalists face similar problems of deprivation and problems around jobs, housing and regeneration. Cultural warfare He often speaks for the protestors at the Twaddell Avenue camp in north Belfast, a symbol of loyalist fury over the parading and flags. Mr Solinas acknowledged there is a sense of cultural warfare. ""The taking down of our flag at city hall, the demonization of our culture in parading is all things very true to our hearts. It's basically similar to someone coming into your house, rearranging the furniture. It just makes you feel very uncomfortable,"" he said. While Catholics still suffer deprivation, Catholic schools are excelling, providing a route out of poverty. Dr Nolan pointed to a confident nationalist population with a growing middle class, contrasting this with what is happening on the unionist Protestant side. He said even if politicians had agreed the Haass proposals, it would not have solved the difficulty facing society in Belfast. ""This problem was still going to bubble up because what we have is inequality,"" he said. ""We've got a section of our population - young Protestant males - who have no routes out of their poverty. And they experience it as inequality. They experience it as alienation and it will erupt."" Mr Solinas and Dr Nolan agree that there is a lack of political leadership and vision at Stormont. Brian Feeney, an Irish News columnist, said unionist politicians are pretending the changes are not happening while fighting a losing battle. ""It's been like King Canute. They are trying to force back the nationalist tide and it has completely failed,"" he said. ""All the unionist politicians know these statistics quite well. They know exactly where it is heading and they know the only outcome can be accommodation and reconciliation. And as it points out in the report there is peace, but no attempt at reconciliation whatsoever."" Belfast artists are reflecting the realities. Joe McWilliams, from the north of the city, has put on canvass vivid images of marching loyalists outside St Patrick's Church. But another artist, Susan Hughes from the south of the city, has just opened an exhibition at Stormont called quiet peacemakers. Quiet peacemakers The portraits include the late Fr Alec Reid and Lesley Carroll, a Presbyterian minister in Belfast. She said there is not enough acknowledgement of quiet peacemakers and not enough unity among them. ""So maybe we need to get ourselves together and make sure we know what each other is doing. That support and vision that comes from each other would make a big difference. And that makes stronger voice to those in leadership,"" she said. There are young people working to bridge the divide through prayer, music and art. Among them is Ashley Holmes from Youth Initiatives. She is 26 and has been, she says, doing cross-community work since the age of 12. She said young people can be disappointed by a lack of support from politicians, their parent's stories and negative language. ""Our young people are feeling like they are holding everybody else's past on their shoulders. They are feeling they are trying to move forward and trying to be positive, but there are certain things that are holding them back,"" she said. Her vision for the city? Investment, shared space and that a new light would shine on it. There is more on this story on The View, which is available here on the BBC iPlayer.

"input: Banning e-cigs would help prevent them undermining efforts to encourage people to quit smoking, claimed Public Health Wales (PHW). It said e-cigs were not regulated, the amount of nicotine varied widely and users could not tell if they were safe. A recent poll of nearly 1,000 people for BBC Breakfast suggested most people supported their use in public places and did not want to see a ban. The British Medical Association has already called for e-cigs to be banned in public places, fearing it could normalise behaviour which has largely become socially unacceptable. However, more than a million people in the UK use them, and the smoking ban does not apply because e-cigs vaporise liquid nicotine and do not create smoke. PHW said that in response to ""confusion about whether electronic cigarettes are harmful or helpful"" it had reviewed the available evidence on e-cigs to help health professionals and the public. Dr Julie Bishop, consultant in public health for PHW, said: ""One of the goals of tobacco control policy in the UK and internationally has been to de-normalise smoking, to create an environment in which not smoking is the norm. ""E-cigs mimic smoking a cigarette and some of the promotional material appears like cigarette advertisements. ""There is much more work to do but anything which may reverse the progress would be a risk to population health."" She said the amount of nicotine varied widely between e-cig brands and users had no way of knowing what was in them. 'Impossible to test' Similarly, because e-cigs were not licensed or regulated, it was ""impossible to carry out accurate tests across the board to determine whether all e-cigs are effective and safe"", she said. Dr Bishop said the position over future regulation of e-cigs remained unclear. However, she added: ""Like regular cigarettes, e-cigs should be prohibited in workplaces, educational and public places to ensure their use does not undermine all of the good work that has gone into smoking prevention and smoking cessation by reinforcing or normalising the habit."" PHW said one person died from smoking-related illness every 90 minutes in Wales, with smoking the biggest cause of avoidable ill health and early death in the UK. Dr Pat Riordan, director of the Health and Healthcare Improvement Division - which runs Stop Smoking Wales - said: ""The last thing we want to do is alienate smokers who are using e-cigs in good faith as a part of their attempt to cut down or quit smoking. ""Warnings and regulation of e-cigs is not about trying to restrict access to products that people find useful, but it's about ensuring that smokers who choose to use these products can use them confidently."" BBC Breakfast recently conducted a poll on e-cigs. When asked: ""Would you feel uncomfortable if someone used an e-cigarette near you are your family?"" 75% said ""No"". And asked if e-cigarettes should be banned in public places, 34% agreed but 62% said ""No"".

Regulators said the bank used super-fast trading systems to reject unprofitable client orders, then failed to disclose why they were rejected. In May, Barclays was fined $2.4bn for manipulating the forex market. ""We are pleased that Barclays worked with us to resolve this matter,"" said Anthony Albanese, acting superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services. ""This case highlights the need for greater oversight and action to help prevent the misuse of automated, electronic trading platforms on Wall Street, which is a wider industry issue that requires serious additional scrutiny."" Barclays was one of five major banks fined this summer for manipulating foreign exchange markets. JP Morgan, Citibank, RBS and UBS were fined a total of $5.7bn. Regulators said that between 2008 and 2012, several traders formed a cartel and used chat rooms to manipulate prices in their favour.

"input: Frances Andrade died at her home in Guildford, Surrey on 24 January 2013, a week after testifying against ex-choirmaster Michael Brewer. The violinist did not live to see her abuser jailed for six years, for five counts of indecent assault. Brewer abused Mrs Andrade at Chetham's School of Music in Manchester. Mark Callaghan from the Crown Prosecution Services (CPS) told the inquest at Woking Coroner's Court he had been unaware of ""the fragility of Mrs Andrade's health"". She had taken drug overdoses in October and December 2012 and again on 3 January 2013. Richard Travers, the Surrey Coroner, asked Mr Callaghan: ""Did you know by the time of the trial there had been a number of overdoses that had been increasing in number and seriousness, as the the trial approached?"" Mr Callaghan answered: ""No sir. The only incidents we were made aware of was an incident in January 2012 and incidents at the end of April or May 2012. ""We knew she wanted a family member at court with her, we knew she was keen to face her abuser in court, and we knew she wanted the case to proceed. ""We didn't know she had been hospitalised."" Delays in care Mr Callaghan told the hearing the CPS had been in touch regularly with Mrs Andrade between May and August 2012 and in January 2013 and she had never indicated that she did not want to proceed with the case. Earlier, Doug Stewart, service manager for Guildford Community Health Recovery Service, told the coroner about delays in offering support to Mrs Andrade following her overdoses. He said it had been ""weeks, possibly months"" after she overdosed in October 2012 before a care co-ordinator was appointed. Seven days after she died, Mrs Andrade's GP received a letter from the mental health trust stating she was at a ""high risk of accidental overdose"". The inquest continues.

"input: Authorities say Sandra Bland hanged herself, but her family says she would not have taken her own life. A video was found on her Facebook page in which she said she was suffering from ""a little bit of depression"" and post-traumatic stress disorder. Her death follows a series of cases in which black people have died in police custody or during arrest. Bland had been stopped by police after improperly signalling a lane change while driving. She was arrested after allegedly kicking a police officer after the traffic stop. Family members were shocked by her death, unable to believe she would have killed herself. A second video showed Bland saying ""Depression is nothing but the devil"" and that ""it's a daily struggle"". The FBI has launched an investigation, following the start of a separate inquiry by the Texas Rangers law enforcement agency. The 28-year-old had just moved to Texas from Illinois to start a new job. Her sister Shante Needham said Bland called her from jail, saying she did not know why she had been arrested and that an officer had possibly broken her arm. Bland died by asphyxiation using a plastic bag to hang herself in her cell, according to Waller County District Attorney Elton Mathias. Video footage did not show what happened inside Bland's cell, but did suggest no one entered or left it until someone found her unconscious. The Texas Commission on Jail Standards cited the Waller County Jail three years ago for not checking all inmates once an hour. Another inmate hanged himself with a bed sheet in 2012. Jail Sheriff Glen Smith said his staff checked on Bland less than an hour before she was found dead. Texas state senator Royce West asked the Texas Department of Public Safety to release video of the arrest and called her death ""suspicious"".

"input: The former chancellor introduced metro mayors in devolution plans for English regions while in government. He told a conference of northern business leaders mayors were now part of the ""national conversation"". But Mr Burnham has said England has ""devolution in name but not in reality"". The Labour former cabinet minister has been at war with Prime Minister Boris Johnson over financial support for his region, which culminated in the PM imposing tier three coronavirus restrictions. Later, in an interview with the BBC's Newscast, Mr Osborne warned Mr Johnson against being ""at war"" with the Treasury, following the latest round of financial support being announced. He told the prime minister to ""embrace"" his position as ""First Lord of the Treasury"" - the additional role held by the PM - adding: ""You know the prime minister who makes use of the Treasury, where you really do have a lot of policy-making capacity, is a prime minister who is going to be more powerful."" Mr Osborne, who among other roles now leads the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, called for more devolution during the Covid recovery. Speaking to the Great Northern Conference, he said he could see ""real representation in the North"". ""We now have a national political conversation where representatives of the north of England are heard on our national news. ""And that is a fantastic success story,"" he added, referring to coverage of Mr Burnham's clash with the government over financial support for Manchester. ""We need to be more courageous in giving many more powers to these local elected leaders,"" Mr Osborne said, as ""we're beginning to see a much more balanced, healthy British society and state where not every decision is taken at Westminster and other voices are heard."" ""But we've got much more to do."" But speaking at a parliamentary select committee meeting on Thursday, Mr Burnham said England had ""devolution in name but not in reality"". Mr Burnham rejected accusations he had been ""posturing"" during the failed negotiations with the government. He accused ministers of operating a ""divide and rule"" strategy, which he said was ""not the way to get a through a pandemic"" which has had a ""severe"" impact on his region. Mr Burnham was supported at the Commons business committee by Steve Rotheram, the mayor of the Liverpool City Region, who said that ""for far too long too many decisions have been taken with London centricity - not just the area of London, but the overall London culture that exists in Parliament"". Mr Rotheram was the first regional mayor to make an agreement with the government for his area to adopt tier three restrictions. Since 2017, eight English regions have appointed directly elected mayors. This means 12m people in England, over 20% of the population, now live in mayoral authority areas. Mayors have some powers over policy areas such as adult education and transport, but these vary from region to region. The eight new regional mayors operate under a different system to London, which elected its first mayor in 2000. The Conservative Party's 2019 election manifesto committed to ""full devolution across England... so that every part of our country has the power to shape its own destiny,"" which is set include more metro mayors. The government was due to publish a white paper on the subject in 2020, but the Financial Times reported it had been delayed until next year. In a speech via video link to the Great Northern Conference, Mr Johnson reiterated the government's commitment to ""level up"" the North of England. ""Even now, as we are still up to our thighs in the mud of the trenches, grappling with this virus, my message to you is that it cannot be enough simply to get through the crisis. We must build back better, build back stronger, build back faster,"" he said. He added: ""That means our work to level up and unleash the talent and potential of the North - by investing in education, skills and infrastructure - is now more urgent than ever. ""We will move departments of state, ministers, private offices and all, to great Northern cities and regions that represent the future of this country.""

"input: Chorley Council has objected to plans for the Cuerden retail park near Bamber Bridge in Lancashire amid concerns it could threaten its £17m town centre redevelopment. The authority is seeking the compensation from the developers and backers Lancashire County Council about the planned 65-hectare retail park. They said the ""money is not justified"". The developers said the site features restaurants and a hotel and would also create 4,500 jobs and could house offices and shops, as well as the Ikea store. But Chorley Council is concerned the plans could drive people away from its own new-look town centre, which will feature a cinema and new high street shops. The planning application will be dealt with by South Ribble Borough Council next month. Chorley Council has written a letter spelling out concerns, including fears about the impact of increased traffic. The council's deputy leader Peter Wilson said the council had been watching the plans ""very closely"" and wanted to ""protect the interests"" of Chorley. He added: ""While we want to see economic growth across Lancashire, we are concerned that the proposals don't properly address the impact that a development of that size could have on Chorley town centre and the traffic and highways surrounding the area. ""For those reasons, we cannot support the proposals as they currently stand."" The council's objection letter demands ""a financial contribution of £11,520,121.00 to mitigate the impact of the Cuerden development"". A spokesman for the Cuerden Strategic Site developers said: ""We are aware that Chorley Council has objected to the Cuerden application, however it is unclear from their letter what the justification is for doing so. ""Following a detailed and robust assessment, our own professional advisers have concluded that the potential retail impacts on neighbouring areas are acceptable. ""Therefore, Chorley Council's request for a significant sum of money by way of mitigation is not justified.""

The substance will be mixed with latex to produce a material which will encourage use by ""enhancing sensation"". Graphene, the thinnest, strongest material known, was first isolated at the University of Manchester in 2004. It has more often been linked to potentially revolutionising products such as smartphones and broadband. Its discovery won Manchester-based scientists Sir Andre Geim and Sir Kostya Novoselov the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010. First 'everyday use' The charity has offered the Grand Challenges Explorations grant to the Manchester research team to develop new composite materials for condoms, which it wants to make more desirable in order to increase global usage. Dr Papa Salif Sow, senior program officer on the HIV team at the foundation, said a ""redesigned condom that overcomes inconvenience, fumbling or perceived loss of pleasure would be a powerful weapon in the fight against poverty"". Dr Aravind Vijayaraghavan, who will lead the researchers, said that since it was isolated, ""people have wondered when graphene will be used in our daily life"". ""Currently, people imagine using graphene in mobile phone screens, food packaging and chemical sensors. ""If this project is successful, we might have [an everyday] use which will literally touch our everyday life in the most intimate way."" The National Graphene Institute at the University of Manchester is being established with a £23m grant from the European Regional Development Fund. The five-floor building is set to open in 2015, creating 100 jobs.

"input: Amol RajanMedia editor Silicon Valley is what happened when the flower power generation sobered up. Steve Jobs was a Buddhist, though to what extent has been the subject of much debate. And the zealous mission on which Facebook is embarked - to create a more open and connected world, smashing barriers instinctively - owes a substantial debt to the baby boomers and their own particular doctrine, (John) Lennonism. When Mark Zuckerberg speaks, I always hear the lyrics to Imagine. Perhaps it is this moral component to what Silicon Valley's biggest companies do that has, for the most part, protected them from what I had long considered inevitable: a monumental backlash. Tech-lash I call this the tech-lash, and thought it would have two main components. First, anti-capitalism: the hostility toward plutocracy shown by groups such as Occupy Wall Street would, eventually, take aim at the astronomical wealth of tech billionaires - especially once it dawned on these protesters, and society at large, that compared to the industrialists of old, these companies don't actually employ many people. As a result, of the vast capital they have amassed, a disconcertingly small amount actually makes it to the labour force. That smells like trickle-down economics - without the trickle down. The second component of the tech-lash would arise from concerns about privacy, fuelled not least by the revelations from Edward Snowden. It is hard to get your head around just how much data companies such as Google and Facebook hold, and how much information they have about us - most of it voluntarily given over. If the civil liberties brigade ever needed a cause around which to rally, this could well be it. Together with disgust at how little taxes these companies pay, you have the elements of an almighty revolt. And yet, it hasn't really come: partly, I imagine, because of that sense of moral purpose; and partly because of the fact that these brilliant and uniquely innovative companies have improved our lives without asking us to pay a penny. Your appetite for being horrible toward Google is neutered when you use Gmail to rally comrades to a cause, and Google Maps to get to a protest. Changing mood This, then, was the tech-lash that wasn't. Until now. Two stories this week suggest that the mood is changing. On Tuesday, the Home Affairs Select Committee gave a ferocious grilling to senior executives from Facebook, Google and Twitter. The Daily Mail is usually a good indicator of which way the wind is blowing; its front page headline on Wednesday was ""Shaming of the web giants"". The next story that showed public feeling might be turning was on the front of another British newspaper - the Financial Times. And yet the story wasn't about Britain. The splash headline was: ""Berlin plans €50m [£44m] fines for hate speech and fake news"". This is a remarkable story: the German government is drafting legislation that will aggressively target internet companies, including social media giants, if they don't do enough to stop the spread of socially corrosive material online, particularly by giving users tools to flag such material. Germany is uniquely susceptible to the spread of fake news. Angela Merkel's hugely controversial refugees policy, the rise of the nationalist Alternative for Germany party, the constant threat from neo-Nazis, upcoming national elections, and the staid media landscape - staid compared with Britain's raucous tabloids, for instance - all make conditions ripe for exploitation. But Germany is now leading the fight-back. Germans have a very different approach to the state to that which is fashionable on America's West Coast. The new tech giants are often libertarians who believe that innovation and technology can solve social problems much more effectively than government. They are diametrically opposed to what you might, crudely, call the Teutonic faith in regulation: many Germans - and indeed all those I spoke to while reporting there - believe that a smart, enabling state can, through effective legislation, mitigate social ills. If the much heralded tech-lash is finally upon us, it is the Germans who hold the whip hand. It isn't hatred of plutocracy, or love of privacy, that finally turned the temper of a people against tech giants: it is the threat of election, and legislative power falling into the hands of nasty forces, that has prompted action. Moreover, it took the German faith in the efficacy of regulation to confront those giants with the threat of punitive action. If the German proposal becomes legislation, it will offer a template that could be rolled out elsewhere. Whether this is the beginning of a tech-lash - a concerted effort by societies and government to, ahem, take back control from tech companies - or just an incremental development in a constantly maturing new world of law and power, is unclear. I would hope, whatever the regulatory fallout of the fake news phenomenon, the likes of Facebook and Google continue to earn immense respect for being better at providing exceptional services to customers than most companies in history. Will the UK follow? Does that include the British? Yes, basically: our political class reveres Silicon Valley and hopes to replicate its success over here. But my conversations in Westminster lead me to believe that, in Theresa May, we have a leader who is not far off the pragmatic, populist patriotism of Mrs Merkel; that, like the German chancellor, our prime minister is a provincial Tory who believes in the good that government can do. Given her one-nation rhetoric, Mrs May will be conscious that fake news - which Facebook is taking very seriously - does potentially pose a threat to the social solidarity. The prime minister and her most senior lieutenants are very close observers of German affairs, and there are people close to the top of British government who are wondering what they can learn, and imitate, from this week's German proposal. In recent years, the moral fervour of those sons and daughters of the 1960s who have come to dominate Silicon Valley, and all our lives, has forged an alliance with wealth and power of a kind most of us can't imagine. What happens when it clashes with the alternative worldview of people in faraway lands who have elections to win, and hatred to silence, will determine much of this, the first truly digital chapter in history.

"input: Kamal AhmedEconomics editor@bbckamalon Twitter That the present Brexit process has had negative effects on the broader economy and on people's incomes. And that a Brexit deal where there is no formal agreement between Britain and the European Union would make those effects worse. As Mark Carney said to me in an interview earlier this week to mark the 10th anniversary of the financial crisis, Brexit is one of the Big Four risks the Bank is facing. A debt crisis in China, problematically high household debt in the UK and a catastrophic cyber-attack taking out a whole bank are the others. ""There are risks around Brexit for the financial sector,"" he told me. ""And here's something that's changed with the system from 10 years ago - we are absolutely upfront about those risks, our view of those risks. ""We have stress tested our banks against those risks to make sure they have enough of a safety net, both in terms of their own funds plus liquid funds, in case we had a no deal Brexit."" Doomsday scene The key phrase is ""stress tested"". The Bank's Financial Policy Committee regularly sets ""doomsday scenarios"" to test the banking system's robustness in the face of a significant shock. The last stress test in November involved a scenario where house prices fell by 33%, interest rates rose to 4% and unemployment doubled. It became known as the ""no deal test"" and is remarkably close to the headlines we are seeing this morning. It appears that the Governor wasn't providing the Cabinet with a forecast of what the Bank believes would happen in the event of a no deal Brexit. He was briefing the Cabinet on what preparations the Bank was making if that does happen, including last November's stress test. It was not a forecast. Negative It was an apocalyptic test where the Bank deliberately sets the parameters beyond what might reasonably be expected to occur. The major banks all passed the test, giving reassurance that the financial system can cope with whatever happens next year. The Governor believes that a ""no deal"" scenario would be bad for the economy. But not as bad as the headlines today which are based on a doomsday scenario that is not actually forecast to happen. There is another point that is often lost in the loudness of the negative headlines. If there is a ""good deal"" with the EU, Mr Carney believes there could be a significant boost to the economy as pent-up demand held back by the present uncertainty is released. Investment could rise markedly, he has argued. Those are the options as he sees them, and it is up to the politicians on both sides of the negotiation to come to a decision on which route they take.

"input: By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent That is according to an email to schools from the Department of Education (DE). The department said evidence from the Public Health Authority's (PHA) contact tracing service suggested too many children and staff without symptoms were getting tested. Concerns have already been expressed about capacity in the testing system. In an email accompanying revised guidance for schools, DE said school staff or pupils should only get a test when they were clearly symptomatic. ""PHA have asked us to emphasise to schools that pupils and staff must only be advised to seek a Covid-19 test when they are symptomatic of the virus - that is a new continuous cough, a fever or a new loss of taste and/or smell,"" said the department. ""Early evidence from the contact tracing service is that available testing capacity is being utilised to test many children and school staff who are showing no symptoms and in doing so make it more challenging for genuinely symptomatic individuals to access a test."" Guidance 'confusion' The department also provided new guidance to schools on when pupils have to self-isolate if one of their classmates has Covid-19. That comes after previous guidance issued last Thursday caused confusion for many principals by suggesting that class bubbles should be sent home if one pupil in the class had symptoms of the virus, such as a persistent cough. ""In practical terms this would have meant that anytime a child got COVID-19 symptoms, for most primary schools and many post primary schools, the entire bubble would have been sent home,"" DE has now said. ""PHA has advised the correct position is that only when a positive case has been identified in a symptomatic child, young person or member of staff do schools need to consider self-isolating close contacts of that individual."" ""Close contacts must stay in isolation for the full 14 day period."" ""They should not return to school before the 14 day isolation period as they may still be incubating the virus - regardless of a lack of symptoms."" While many schools in Northern Ireland have sent staff or groups of pupils home to self-isolate after positive cases, some schools have closed entirely for a number of days. On Monday, St Comgall's Primary in Bangor announced it was closing for 14 days after several cases of coronavirus were identified, although the school said on Tuesday it would reopen to most classes on Friday.

"input: Five men and a woman were arrested at addresses in West Yorkshire and Bournemouth in connection with the theft and cloning of 180 vehicles. Several high-value cars and number plates were recovered as well as a lock-picking kit and diagnostics machine used to reprogram vehicles. West Yorkshire Police said the ring had been operating since 2009. Det Supt Pat Twiggs said: ""The operation is focused on vehicles being stolen, primarily in the south of England, without keys using specialist equipment and then transported to Leeds where they are professionally cloned using the identities of legitimate vehicles and sold to innocent buyers through used car publications and websites."" He said the men, aged 46, 44, 39, 37 and 32, and woman, aged 43, were arrested at addresses in Alwoodley, Yeadon and Adel, in Leeds, and at properties in Idle, in Bradford, and in Bournemouth. An industrial unit was also raided in Pudsey. All six people have been released on bail pending further inquires. Among the vehicles recovered were an Aston Martin Vantage worth £38,00 and an Audi Q7 worth £16,000.

Test Valley Borough Council granted permission for the park for 25 years subject to a number of conditions, including the restoration of the site to its original state. The project will be built next summer, Hive Energy said. The 72-hectare (178-acre) park is expected to supply energy to about 9,100 homes. Its closeness to Hive Energy's head office will allow the latest solar and storage technologies to be tested, the firm said. ""A biodiversity management plan will be put in place for the 25 year life-span of the solar park,"" it added. ""This will see the development of conservation areas within the site alongside sheep grazing, wildflower seeding and the planting of new trees and hedgerows to encourage birds, bats and insects.""

"input: Neil Rhodes was suspended in February by the county's police and crime commissioner (PCC), Alan Hardwick. Mr Hardwick said the suspension related to Mr Rhodes' alleged support for an employee on another force. Mr Rhodes' legal team argued the PCC had overreacted and he should be reinstated. The case has been adjourned until Thursday when the judge is expected to give his ruling. Suspension 'reasonable' Mr Rhodes was suspended over allegations he helped a senior Muslim lawyer from West Yorkshire Police use his ethnicity to pursue damages following his dismissal. His legal team argued that the suspension was ""unlawful and irrational"". Mr John Beggs QC told the hearing at the High Court in Manchester: ""This PCC overreacted, perhaps through not having the experience, or advice, or assistance to appreciate that suspension is a last resort, a near nuclear option."" But Mr Hardwick's lawyers argued that it was perfectly rational and reasonable to suspend Mr Rhodes on the basis of the information the PCC had received. The court heard Mr Rhodes had ""friended"" the lawyer, who was dismissed from West Yorkshire Police after 17 years and was suing his former employer. Mr Rhodes then became involved in the proceedings, and the pursuit of racial discrimination claims which he knew to be untrue, the court was told. But his lawyers argued that he simply tried to get the various parties around the table to talk and did not know enough about the claim to offer any opinion on it. The court heard Mr Rhodes believes, rightly or wrongly, that the lawyer's dismissal was based on discrimination. Mr Rhodes was appointed as temporary chief constable in March 2012, but suspended in February. The matter was referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), but it decided not to investigate. Mr Hardwick appointed Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, to hold an independent investigation into the police chief's suspension.

"input: By Steve Duffy and Gwyndaf HughesBBC News Health officials and ministers have been watching closely how Covid-19 has been progressing before reaching the decision. Here are some of the factors they have been considering - in six charts. 1 How has Covid-19 spread across Wales? The video above shows a map of the case rate across the nation over the past two months. You can watch the rolling seven-day positive cases per 100,000 for each county in Wales - and how that rate has increased in different areas. The figures are based on Public Health Wales data, issued daily. 2 How have cases been increasing? This shows how the number of positive cases have grown in total - but not always at the same speed, depending on where you live. The maxim ""west is best"" might apply here but even Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire, the least affected areas, have seen a rise. 3 Local lockdowns have not been enough Caerphilly was the first area to go into local lockdown, more than six weeks ago. At the time, its case rate doubled within a few days and reached 117 cases per 100,000 people - the highest rate in Wales and one of the highest in the UK. It peaked within a few days and started to fall back, to 50 cases per 100,000. A month into lockdown, it began to rise again. The figure this week is back up to where it was at the start of lockdown. Looking within the county, the case rate in recent weeks was particularly high in Abertridwr and Senghenydd - the Aber valley west of Caerphilly itself - although that has since dropped back. The local hotspots in the past week are in the Rhymney valley, around Hengoed and Ystrad Mynach. The county has also seen a cluster of positive tests among workers at the Peter's pie factory in Bedwas. The council leader said it did not mean that local lockdown had not worked - but that the measures had mitigated what might have been even worse. Philippa Marsden said: ""I'm sure you can imagine how worse the situation would be if we hadn't introduced the restrictions when we did. It is clear from the UK-wide data that all our efforts have prevented the kind of very large spikes of infection we are seeing elsewhere in the UK."" 4 Student areas have shown particular clusters Even within local areas we can see how some areas have particular hotspots, including in student areas. Bangor in Gwynedd went into its own local area lockdown, associated with a spike in student cases. Similar patterns can be seen in Cardiff, with more cases in those parts of the city where hundreds of students have tested positive, and to a lesser extent in Aberystwyth. Before the Wales-wide ""firebreak"" lockdown, Aberystwyth had not been under any extra restrictions, and the university said its total cases between September 4 and October 23 numbered 37. 5 R number - it has risen again Another key area, which health officials and ministers have been looking at is the reproduction or R number. This measures infection and how it reproduces. Anything above 1 and it means more people can be infected. The R number is currently between 1 and 1.4. Back in April it was 2.8 and you can see how it dipped over the summer - with infections so low that the R number itself became unreliable to use as a guide. 6 More patients are in hospital The number of patients in hospital with Covid-19 is going up. It is not up to the peak of the pandemic but it is already at two-thirds of the numbers we saw back then. There has been an expectation that if there are rising cases in the community among older and more vulnerable people, then these will start to show up in hospital. Hospital admissions are also rising, while critical care beds are now above the normal capacity. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the firebreak was ""vital"" to prevent hospitals from being over-run.

"input: By Dean McLaughlinBBC News NI Springtown Camp was heavily guarded by US Marines during World War Two but locals moved in when the Americans left. People in the city could not get adequate housing so they squatted in the camp in the 1940s, '50s and '60s. The camp closed in 1967 and some of the residents reunited in October 2017. The proposed model Nissen hut would be based at the junction of the Springtown and Northland roads. Derry City and Strabane District Council said it has received a planning application for the proposed monument. Willie Deery, who lived at the camp, is behind the proposed monument. ""This would be a fitting tribute,"" Mr Deery told BBC News NI. ""Hugo McConnell and myself thought about it for a long time and everyone has been really supportive. ""Yes, there were extremely difficult times and people even died on the camp. But there are so many lovely stories too. ""There's a team of people behind the scenes working on funding and we're hoping the model hut would attract visitors to the area. ""It would mark a very important era and the local people would appreciate it."" The site had 302 Nissen huts, a chapel, gym, laundry, canteen, barber's shop, theatre and even a jail. But the huts had no water, electricity or heating. After a public outcry, the Unionist Majority Corporation, which had obtained power through gerrymandering, granted temporary rentals to the new residents and charged rent. That agreement was to last six months and the families were to be allocated housing. That didn't happen. Actress Jane Russell sparked an international furore in 1951 when she adopted a child from a mother living in poverty within the camp.

"input: By Ciaran McCauley BBC News NI The note, worth an estimated £50,000, was found in Northern Ireland by a woman known only as ""J"". She sent the fiver back to the Scottish gallery it came from, and asked for it to be used to benefit a charitable cause. ""£5 note enclosed, I don't need it at my time of life. Please use it to help young people,"" she wrote. The anonymous benefactor is known to be from County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland. The Tony Huggins-Haig Gallery, in Kelso, Scotland, told BBC News NI the five-pound note would likely be auctioned off in aid of Children in Need. The gallery created the notes in conjunction with Birmingham micro-artist Graham Short. Just four notes were specially engraved and spent in each of the home countries. The first was found in a café in south Wales in December, with the second discovery coming in Scotland inside a Christmas card the same month. England is now the only area yet to discover its jackpot Austen note. However, it is Ireland's anonymous donor who is causing the biggest stir after she discovered the rare fiver - and handed it back. According to the gallery, the woman got in touch in mid-January to tell them she had found the note while visiting Enniskillen in County Fermanagh. The artist, Graham Short, had previously told the BBC that he spent it ""in a small bar called Charlie's Bar"". When the gallery asked the woman to prove her find, she sent them a picture of the note, verifiable through its serial number, along with a dated copy of her local newspaper, the Donegal Democrat. Michael Huggins, the gallery's assistant manager, said the woman then asked for a couple of weeks to ""mull over"" what she might do with it. ""Then we received this note in the mail along with the fiver,"" he told BBC News NI. ""The note just said she wanted it to be used to help young people."" There are few clues as to the identity of the unidentified Donegal donor. The woman spoke on the phone to gallery artist Tony Huggins-Haig, Michael said, who described her voice as ""soft"" and ""older"". ""With that and the note when she refers to her age, we think it's an older woman,"" he added. ""But, all we know is that she is from County Donegal and that she wants the money to go to benefit young people."" He added that the gallery had been in touch with Children in Need, and it's likely the note will be auctioned with an added bonus. ""It seems we'll auction it off, but we've also spoken to the artist Graham Short about creating another one-off note as well. So we'll auction both off together.""

"input: Hugh PymHealth editor@bbcHughPymon Twitter Looking forward there has been a warning that the government's planned £8bn a year extra by 2020 will not be enough. Looking back, it has become clear that the Department of Health only just kept within the budget agreed by Parliament last year. First, the department's annual report for the 2014/15 year and what it tells us. If this sounds dull and technical and not everybody's idea of a gripping read, please bear with me. 'Harrier jet' The report was issued on Tuesday in the final hours of the parliamentary session and shone new light on what it costs to keep the NHS in England afloat. On the important day-to-day spending definition (known to the cognoscenti as RDEL), the Department of Health shelled out £110.5bn in the financial year which ended in March. The annual report says this was an under-spend of £1.2m on the total agreed by Parliament. That may sound like a reasonable cushion but in Whitehall terms it's nothing - equivalent to 0.001% of the budget. It is rather like ending the month with one penny in the bank account after paying the mortgage and all the bills. Given that only two years ago the department ended the year with an under-spend of £1.5bn, the £1.2m result in 2014/15 is put into some sort of context. The job of finance chiefs in steering the department through to the end of the year within the agreed budget has been likened to landing a Harrier jet on a tennis court. For the year just ended it must have been like landing that jump jet on a flower bed. 'Short shrift' All this is more intriguing because the Department of Health only just scraped by despite an injection of £890m in extra funding over the course of the financial year. This consisted of £250m of money quietly transferred from Treasury reserves, with the rest moved from investment budgets into covering day-to-day running costs. So it was a close-run thing in 2014/15, and the current financial year does not look as if it will be any easier. Deficits at health trusts seem set to be bigger than last year. Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, told MPs on Tuesday that the single biggest factor was the rapid growth in spending on agency staff. It was critical, he said, that this was dialled back in the months ahead. Further afield, ministers are hoping that the £8bn annual funding boost by 2020 which they have promised will be enough for the NHS in England to continue delivering current levels of care. But a report out on Wednesday by two leading think tanks challenges that assumption. The Health Foundation and the King's Fund have called for more investment over and above the £8bn to create what they call a transformation fund. This vehicle, the authors say, would invest in measures needed to create longer-term efficiency savings - for example, the retraining of some frontline staff and the development of new ways of caring for patients. The NHS, they argue, will not become more productive without upfront investment of an extra £1.5 - £2bn per year. But the think tanks received short shrift from the government, with a spokesperson pointing out that the NHS had asked in its five-year strategy paper for the £8bn by 2020 and now had to get on with the job of finding efficiency savings. But the thorny question of money and what is deliverable by the health service will continue to cause furrowed brows in Whitehall and Downing Street as the autumn spending review approaches.

Carlington Grant, Khianna Lewis and Jermaine Dornan were found guilty of two counts of selling prohibited firearms. They were also convicted of possessing or acquiring ammunition. Grant, known as ""Mad Dog"", 41, of Johnson Street, Wolverhampton, was sentenced to 26 years at Birmingham Crown Court. Lewis, 34, of Columbus Avenue, Brierley Hill, was sentenced to 17 years. Dornan, 30, of Temple Street, Wolverhampton was also convicted of supplying cocaine and was sentenced to nine years in jail on Wednesday. The court heard how Grant and Lewis funded the purchase of the guns and ammunition from a firm in Calais before converting them. Officers spotted two semi-automatic handguns being handed over in a shoe box in a Kingswinford supermarket car park. Serial numbers on the guns led officers to the firm in France which had legally despatched them as part of a shipment to an address in Cornwall. Grant and Lewis made four trips to Cornwall to collect the guns before storing and converting them at a unit on the Black Lake Industrial Estate in West Bromwich which was later raided by police. In May last year another of Grant's converted pistols was dropped during an armed raid on a carpet shop in Tyburn Road, Erdington, police said. Warren Stanier from the CPS said: ""Their illegal activities have put innocent members of the public in danger."" Speaking following sentencing, Det Con Rory Juss, said that Grant and Lewis used the money to ""fund a lavish lifestyle of luxury cars and regular trips abroad"".

And Robin Windsor, who had to pull out of last year's series due to a back injury, will also not feature in the forthcoming series. Lukosiute, who partnered rugby player Thom Evans last year, has been on the show for three years. She said it was a ""pleasure to be part of this wonderful show"". She said she will focus this year on her dance school in New York but ""will be more than happy to stay involved with the show in the future"". Australian Trent, who had previously appeared on Australian and American versions of the show, was brought in last year to replace the injured Windsor. As partner to one of last year's favourites, singer Pixie Lott, he was often top of the leader board. He said he ""was very happy to be part of last season and very thankful for the opportunity"". Windsor said he was ""devastated"" to miss out on last year's series due to injury. Today he tweeted his sadness at leaving. Fans have been tweeting their dismay at losing him. Lisa Riley, who partnered Windsor in 2012, tweeted he would be ""a huge loss to the programme"". ""Sad day today finding out the PHENOMENAL @Robinwindsor will not be back on Strictly!He will be a HUGE loss to the programme! Love him"" There had been a lot of press speculation at the end of the last series suggesting Jordan might not return to the show. Jordan - whose husband James was formerly on the show - had signed up for the C4 reality show The Jump but she was injured before the programme began earlier this year.

"input: By Mario CacciottoloBBC News It seems like every time a World Cup or an Olympics appears on the horizon, so do warnings from the international press, government ministers and police. They all express fears that thousands of women will be trafficked to the host nation to satisfy the sexual desires of the crowds. The same messages have long been issued for the London 2012 Olympic Games. In January 2010 Tessa Jowell, then Minister for the Olympics in the previous government, told MPs: ""Major sporting events can be a magnet for the global sex and trafficking industry; this is wholly unacceptable. I am determined that traffickers will not exploit London 2012."" And Dennis Hof, who owns the Moonlite Bunny Ranch, a large-scale brothel in Nevada, US, says he expects London to see ""1,000 girls to be trafficked in by South East Asian, Albanian and African gangs, violent gangs involved in crime and drugs"". Hof, who wants to run a legal brothel during the Olympics, bases his prediction on what he said he saw at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada. But are such warnings accurate? The 2004 Olympic Games in Athens seems to be the first major international sporting event to have invoked widespread warnings about a rise in prostitutes and sex workers. It is often reported to have seen its sex trafficking almost doubling. However, a report by the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women (GAATW) shows the number of cases in Athens during the whole of 2004 was 181, up from 93 in 2003 - a far cry from the many thousands of women said to be threatened by trafficking in these situations. None of these 181 cases were linked to the Games by Greek authorities. Prior to the 2006 World Cup in Germany, similar warnings were issued by media and various officials, but according to an EU report from January 2007, the German government only found five cases of trafficking cases linked to the tournament. The report also states that ""the increase in forced prostitution and human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation during the 2006 World Cup in Germany which was feared by some did not materialise"" with ""no sign whatsoever of the alleged 40,000 prostitutes/forced prostitutes - a figure repeatedly reported, also in international media"". And yet, the 2006 World Cup has been used as an example of an instance where huge numbers of prostitutes were paid for sex by large numbers of the tournament attendees. Sticking with World Cups, a study funded by the United Nations Population Fund and conducted after the 2010 tournament in South Africa found there was no significant change in the numbers of men visiting prostitutes during that event. But there had been broad speculation that between 40,000 and 100,000 sex workers from all over the world would enter South Africa because of that tournament. The 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, held in Vancouver, Canada were also subject to similar speculation - but according to a study conducted afterwards by University of British Columbia researchers, mass trafficking didn't happen there, either. The study says that ""despite sensationalised media coverage"" prior to the Games, there was ""no evidence in this study to support concerns of an influx of sex workers or reports of trafficking of women or girls"". Many have used the experiences of the Greeks, Germans and South Africans to form an argument that London will have to brace itself for increased numbers of sex workers. But more than two years later, Tessa Jowell, who once told the Commons about her determination to combat sex trafficking at London 2012, now admits that ""current intelligence would suggest that we are unlikely to see large scale trafficking into London as a result of the Games"". ""There is some anecdotal evidence to suggest that international sporting events might create demand for paid sex due to the influx of tourists, site workers, contractors, the media and indeed the athletes themselves - although this is contested."" Jowell also says that it is ""hard to know"" whether the lack of evidence for Games-related trafficking ""was a result of the measures that were put in place"" by her officials ""or whether the threat simply hasn't materialised"". ""We would certainly rather be having a conversation about whether the threat of trafficking was ever going to materialise rather than about it as a reality on the streets of London and we should continue to be vigilant in the face of such a threat."" The Metropolitan Police Service's Human Exploitation and Organised Crime Command (SCD9) was set up at the start of 2010 to tackle vice, human trafficking and immigration crime. It has a team focusing on vice-related crime in the five Olympic host boroughs - Newham, Hackney, Waltham Forest, Tower Hamlets and Greenwich. SCD9 was given £600,000 to tackle the potential increase in trafficking in those five boroughs in the run up to 2012. However, a Met Police Authority report on SCD9 published in October 2011 said the ""intelligence currently held does not support any increase in prostitution in the Olympic Boroughs and actually shows a decrease in some locations"". And a Met Police spokesman says SCD9 was set up ""based on assessments made over three years ago"" which had used ""the best information available"" at that time. ""As time has moved on we have not seen any rise in trafficking linked with the Olympics,"" he adds. Conservative London Assembly Member Andrew Boff has compiled the Silence of Violence report which also says there is ""no strong evidence that trafficking for sexual exploitation does in fact increase during sporting events"". He also says raids on brothels were increasing as the Olympics approached, with 80 being closed in the Olympic borough of Newham in the last 20 months or so. Sarah Walker, of the English Collective of Prostitutes, echoes this view, saying recent frequent police raids on east London brothels represent a pre-Olympics crackdown - about which the ECP is ""outraged"". However, the Met Police denied conducting any crackdown, saying it has ""not increased operations targeting brothels in the five Olympic boroughs"" and was ""responding to local concerns and feedback from residents and businesses across London about street prostitution"". Another group representing sex workers, x:talk, is calling for a moratorium on arrests, the detention and deportation of sex workers until the end of the Olympics. A spokeswoman also says police raids on brothels, particularly in east London, are driving sex workers further away from their support network of co-workers and health services, prompting the call for a pause on arrests. ""Ultimately, arresting these women and raiding their places of work just makes them more vulnerable,"" she says.

"input: By Barbara PlettBBC News, United Nations It was contesting elections for five positions with two-year terms. Morocco, Guatemala and Togo have also been elected as new temporary members of the council. The Eastern European seat is still being contested. Pakistan's win means both South Asian nuclear states will serve, but diplomats do not think regional rivalry will play out in a big way there. The positions of Pakistan and India are similar on many international issues. The elections replace five of the 10 temporary members of the council every year. Usually regional groupings endorse the seats in advance, but this year there was an unusually high number of contestants, making the outcome unpredictable. Guatemala ran unopposed and Morocco won easily, but Togo's victory took three rounds and the fifth seat is still contested. Pakistan's ambassador, Abdullah Hussain Haroon, said he expected to work well with his Indian counterpart - he received a congratulatory call from the Indian envoy while talking to journalists. Diplomats say the greater impact may be on wider council dynamics - they suspect Pakistan may join emerging powers in resisting Western attempts to sanction countries such as Syria and Iran. If so, it would continue positions held by Brazil, whose term is ending. Togo's victory ensures a black African presence on the council, something that was in doubt because its run-off was against the Arab state of Mauritania.

"input: The Peak District National Park Authority (PDNPA) is looking for ways of raising money to make 35% savings. One possible plan is to sell the North Lees Estate, which contains a large part of Stanage Edge in Derbyshire - a popular area for climbers and walkers. The authority said it would only sell the estate to the ""right organisation"". 'No compromises' The PDNPA's chief executive, Jim Dixon, said the North Lees Estate was ""very valuable"". ""It is worth an enormous amount to the nation for its landscape, wildlife and access - way more than its capital cash value. ""It's quite unlikely we will end up selling it - it's more likely we'll end up with a long-term lease. ""But I can absolutely guarantee that the decisions we make about the land in the national park will not compromise the access for the community or the conservation."" Henry Folkard, from the BMC, said if the North Lees Estate was sold and shooting rights restored - something which could be considered - access rights would be restricted. ""We're not opposed to the PDNPA raising money but it's the way they go about doing it - some ways are more appropriate than others. ""Anything that restricts access, we would resist strongly."" The PDNPA will meet later this month to discuss its plans.

"input: By Ewan MurrieBBC Scotland news website Campaigners have seized on the centenary to thrust an age-old debate back into the spotlight: Should the UK continue with its current daylight savings system? Whenever it is time for the nation to put the clocks forward or back, it generates some debate on whether we should continue with the arrangements, or keep the UK on BST. This would result in lighter evenings and darker mornings. What is the daylight savings system? Why would we change the current system? Apart from remaining in BST, there have been calls for the UK to adopt Single/Double British Summertime (SDST). SDST would mean GMT+1 during the winter months and GMT+2 in the summer period. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) has campaigned since 1988 to have the system adjusted so that there is more light in the evening during winter months. To mark 100 years of daylight savings, it has renewed an appeal for SDST to be introduced. Rospa says this would reduce the number of accidents because when the sunset occurs earlier in the day, the number of road collisions increase. The Automobile Association (AA) is also in favour of changing the clocks so that there is less light in the morning and more in the evening. However, the proposal to switch to lighter evenings has always struggled to gain popularity in Scotland. If SDST was introduced, the northern-most parts of the country would stay dark until as late as 10:00 on winter mornings. Some have suggested that Scotland could have a different time zone to the rest of the UK - but that is another discussion. If SDST were to be adopted, here are some things that people in the north of Scotland would be doing in the dark. Farming Farm work is tough at the best of times, and according to NFU Scotland - hours of darkness are always more dangerous. The farming union also warned that darker mornings would mean more farm vehicles on the road in these conditions, as some work can not be delayed. Farmers in the north of Scotland are against any proposal to move the nation's clock to SDST. Walking to school If SDST was adopted in the north of Scotland, children would be walking to school in the dark - to the dismay of some parents. The lollipop lady might have something to say too.

"input: By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor A revamped design with an edge-to-edge display, facial recognition ID system and advanced augmented reality features is expected. Several analysts have predicted the asking price for the top-end models will hit new heights too. In a world in which the smartphone has become ubiquitous, it's easy to forget how much of a surprise Steve Jobs's unveiling of the original was a decade ago, and how divided opinion was about whether it was truly a game-changer. To mark the occasion, we have picked 10 key moments from its past. 1. 2004: The birth of Project Purple After the success of first the iMac and then the iPod, Apple began developing a tablet as its next breakthrough product. But around 2004, ex-iOS chief Scott Forstall recalls having a critical conversation over lunch with chief executive Steve Jobs. ""We were both using our phones and hated them,"" he told an audience earlier this year. ""We looked around, and like everyone around us has a phone, and everyone looks very angsty as they're using them. ""And Steve said, 'Do you think we can take that demo we are doing with the tablet and multi-touch and shrink it down to something… small enough to fit in your pocket?'"" This prompted Apple's engineers to create a basic contacts app that was constrained to a corner of the prototype tablet's display. ""The second [Steve Jobs] saw this demo, he knew this was it,"" Mr Forstall said. ""There was no question. This was the way a phone had to behave."" As a legal filing would later reveal, by August 2005 Apple's industrial designers had already created a concept form factor - codenamed Purple - that is recognisable as the basis for the iPhone that followed. 2. July 2008: First iOS App Store apps released There are now well over two million native apps available for the iPhone's iOS operating system, and most owners have several pages and folders worth of the programs. But for a while, after the first iPhone launched, there weren't enough to fill even a single screen. That's because third-party developers were initially limited to creating software that ran within the device's web browser. Steve Jobs reportedly believed policing a native app marketplace would be too complicated. It wasn't until more than a year after the handset went on sale that the App Store was launched. And history was made on 9 July when Apple made a handful of native apps live in advance of the marketplace opening its virtual doors. Among them was Moo - a cow sound simulator - from Denver-based developer Erica Sadun. ""I had come from the jailbreak community [in which developers modify smartphones to add capabilities], which put a lot of pressure on Apple to have its own store,"" Ms Sadun said. ""The App Store completely revolutionised how independent developers could create businesses, monetise their product and present it to a community of people that was larger than anybody had ever dreamed of. ""It created a gold rush that I don't think we are ever going to see again."" 3. September 2008: HTC Dream unveiled It sounds fanciful now, but once upon a time Google's chief executive was a member of Apple's board of directors. Eric Schmidt did not resign from the post until 2009, but his days were numbered as soon as the first commercial Android phone was announced. The HTC Dream offered features the iPhone still lacked, including copy and paste, Street View and multimedia messaging. And while reviews were tepid - suggesting it was ""best suited for early adopters"" - they recognised the potential of a more open smartphone platform to iOS. Curiously, the Dream was theoretically capable of supporting ""multi-touch"" gestures - recognising how many fingers were in contact with the screen - but the feature was disabled. That was probably because Apple had patented the technology. When HTC added the feature to a follow-up handset in 2010, Steve Jobs was infuriated. ""I'm going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product,"" he subsequently told his biographer Walter Isaacson. ""I'm willing to go to thermonuclear war on this."" 4. February 2010: Siri app released by SRI These days, Apple spends millions making adverts starring Siri and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, among other celebrity co-stars. But when the virtual assistant was first released on iOS, it was a relatively low-profile app from a fairly obscure Californian research institute, which had been part-funded by the Pentagon. Its business model was to charge restaurants and event promoters a fee for any voice-controlled bookings made for their businesses, and the plan was to release follow-up versions for Android and Blackberry. But that changed two months after its launch, when Apple bought the technology, reportedly for more than $200m (£150m). The app remained live on the App Store until October 2011, at which point an upgraded version became an exclusive feature for the newly launched iPhone 4S. 5. June 2010: The first selfie iPhone When the iPhone 4 was released, reviews highlighting its addition of a front camera focused on its use for video calls rather than self-portraits. Perhaps that was understandable. Although the word ""selfie"" had already been coined, it had yet to become commonplace. And while the iPhone 4 was not the first handset to feature a camera on both its sides - Sony Ericsson did so in 2003 - it can claim to have been a driving force in the rise of selfie culture. ""The iPhone 4 was important as you had a device that was very easy to use, a big teen demographic with access to it, and an explosion of mobile apps,"" said Charles Arthur, author of Digital Wars. ""It's a classic example of unintended consequences. ""Now, the selfie has taken over from the autograph. ""Watch people at any public event where they are meeting stars, and they're always trying to get a selfie with them."" 6. October 2011: The death of Steve Jobs When Tim Cook - rather than Steve Jobs - unveiled the 4S on 4 October 2011, he faced criticism for his performance. The BBC even accused him of appearing ""dull"". What wasn't apparent at the time was that Mr Cook must have been aware that his mentor and friend Steve Jobs was close to death. He died the next day. It is likely that Apple would have collapsed had Mr Jobs not returned in 1997 to the company he had co-founded, meaning there would never have been an iPhone. Or had he not subsequently stayed at Apple, it's possible the company's engineers might have pursued a rival mobile phone design based around the iPod's click wheel. Certainly, since his death, Apple has yet to launch a product that has come anywhere close to achieving the iPhone's level of success, and some question whether it ever will. Mr Jobs's last public appearance was at Cupertino City Council in June 2011, where he sought permission for Apple to build a new headquarters. The new iPhone will be the first product to be launched at the new campus, within an event space called the Steve Jobs Theater. 7. April 2012: Facebook's $1bn takeover of Instagram If ever proof were needed of the disruptive economic impact of the iPhone, the takeover of Instagram provided it. The app had been in existence only 18 months when the deal was announced. It had just 13 employees and had been an iOS-exclusive until the week before the revelation. Its takeover provided a bonanza to both Instagram's investors as well as to other smartphone-related start-ups seeking venture capital cash. At the time, many thought Facebook had wildly overpaid. Now, as Instagram sucks in ever more advertising dollars while offline media's funding struggles worsen, it seems like a bargain. Other apps that debuted on the iPhone - including Uber, Deliveroo and Airbnb - have shaken up industry in other ways. And by one estimate, the total value of the global app economy - including software sales, advertising and mobile commerce - was $1.3tn (£993bn) for last year. 8. July 2012: Apple buys AuthenTec Apple's $356m takeover of a fingerprint sensor chip-maker in 2012 caused a particular problem for Samsung. The South Korean company was already using the Florida-based company's components in its laptops and had just announced a deal to add another of its security products to its Android phones. But while the idea of frustrating its arch-rival probably had some appeal, the biggest benefit to Apple was the ability to launch its Touch ID system in 2013's iPhone 5S. As reviews noted, previous attempts to introduce fingerprint scanning to phones had proven ""unreliable, often causing more aggravation than they're worth"" but the new system worked ""pretty much flawlessly"". Initially, the feature was limited to being used to unlock the phone and make digital purchases from Apple. But it later made it possible for the company to introduce Apple Pay and add security to third-party apps without requiring the hassle of typing in a password each time. One side-effect of the sensor's success is it may have prolonged the life of a physical home button on the iPhone. If rumours are to be believed, Apple has struggled to replace it with a part that could be hidden beneath the screen and may be about to replace it altogether with facial recognition scans on the iPhone X. 9. August 2013: Steve Ballmer says he is stepping down as Microsoft chief In 1997, Microsoft threw Apple a lifeline by taking a $150m stake in the failing company. Apple returned the favour by launching a product that Microsoft first failed to properly understand and then struggled to match. Chief executive Steve Ballmer famously laughed at the iPhone's prospects after he first heard about it. ""That is the most expensive phone in the world, and it doesn't appeal to business customers because it doesn't have a keyboard,"" he said in 2007. Six years later, he announced the takeover of Nokia's phone business for 5.4bn euros ($6.5bn; £5bn) in an attempt to catch up, only for the sum to be written off in 2015 after he had departed and his successor finally accepted Windows Phone was a flop. The irony is that if Microsoft's stake in Apple had not been sold off under Mr Ballmer, it would now be worth more than $40bn and he might have shared in its success. ""Like so many other people, Steve Ballmer completely underestimated the impact of the iPhone,"" said Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy. ""His arrogant dismissal has certainly come back to haunt him."" 10. July 2016: Pokemon Go released Pokemon Go fever is now well past its peak, and the app more likely to make headlines for botched events than rare monster sightings. But its legacy has been to prove that augmented reality (AR) apps - in which graphics are mixed with real-world views - can have mass appeal. AR actually dates back to 2009 on the iPhone, when a French developer created an app that shows nearby shops and other points of interest in Paris. But it's set to come of age with the imminent release of iOS 11, which includes ARKit - software that makes it easier for developers to anchor graphics to the world beyond and take account of its lighting conditions. Several demos released in advance have looked impressive, not least a version of PacMan where you walk through the maze. The question remains whether users will be satisfied experiencing the action on their iPhones, or whether Apple will feel compelled to release an accompanying headset to let them go hands-free.

"input: It comes after the pandemic has strained many producers and forced the US to scramble for medical gear. The initial review is focused on computer chips, pharmaceuticals, rare earth minerals and large batteries, such as those used in electric cars. China is a key supplier for many of those items. US officials said the review was not targeted at China, which like the US imports most of its computer chips and has been trying to boost domestic production. They said the administration was interested in increasing some production in the US and expected to work with other countries for items that could not be made domestically. Reliance on ""strategic competitor nations"" is expected to be part of the analysis, they added. ""While we cannot predict what crisis will hit us, we should have the capacity to respond quickly in the face of challenges,"" the White House said in a statement announcing the study, which will start with a 100-day focused review, before widening its scope. ""The United States must ensure that production shortages, trade disruptions, natural disasters and potential actions by foreign competitors and adversaries never leave the United States vulnerable again."" Under pressure The president, who will formally sign the executive order on Wednesday, has come under pressure as firms such as General Motors and Ford have cut production and announced lay-offs due to the shortage of chips - key components for many electronic products, which have been in high demand due to the pandemic. Republicans have also pushed Mr Biden to do more to address reliance on China, while business and technology lobby groups have also called on the administration to introduce investment tax credits to encourage the building of more US semiconductor manufacturing plants, where the chips are produced. ""While the governments of our global competitors have invested heavily to attract new semiconductor manufacturing and research facilities, the absence of US incentives has made our country uncompetitive and America's share of global semiconductor manufacturing has steadily declined,"" the groups wrote in a recent letter, signed by the US Chamber of Commerce, the Semiconductor Industry Association and the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, among others. ""To be competitive and strengthen the resilience of critical supply chains, we believe the US needs to incentivize the construction of new and modernized semiconductor manufacturing facilities and invest in research capabilities."" US semiconductor firms currently account for 47% of global chip sales, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. However, just 12% of chips are made in the US, down from 37% in 1990. Under former President Donald Trump, the US adopted a protectionist approach, increasing border taxes and in some cases forbidding US firms from doing business with Chinese competitors in an effort to boost US producers. Amid the changes, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world's largest contract chipmaker, last May announced plans to build a $12bn (£8.5bn) factory in the US.

"input: Nia Griffith was said to be ""livid"" about reports that Mr Corbyn's spokesman had suggested Nato troops should be withdrawn from Estonia. Hours earlier she had told Forces TV she backed the deployment. Sources said she had been assured, in a meeting with the Labour leader, that his spokesman had not said that. 'Ratcheting up' The spokesman did however refer to 'escalating tensions' on the Russia/Nato border and it is understood Ms Griffith did not welcome policy being made ""on the hoof"". Five hundred UK troops are to go to Estonia as part of Nato's effort to deter Russia from any ""aggression"". The UK has been building up its military presence in the Baltic region - sending RAF Typhoons since 2014 - following Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Questioned by reporters in Parliament on Wednesday, Mr Corbyn's spokesman said: ""What we don't want to see is a ratcheting up of tensions between Russia and the West, as has been taking place. We want to see an engagement with Russia - on a critical basis, but a serious basis."" He added: ""We've said repeatedly that we want talks and engagement to wind down military tensions, particularly on the Nato-Russian border and in the Middle East. ""Jeremy has expressed concerns about that being one of the escalations of tensions that have taken place."" BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said the Labour leader has not called for the withdrawal of British troops from Estonia, but it was clear Ms Griffith - and a number of other Labour MPs - were concerned about the leadership's approach to defence. Prior to the comments, Llanelli MP Ms Griffith told Forces TV she thought it ""very important that we now play a very strong role in Nato, particularly as we are leaving the European Union"". Nato had ""to be absolutely clear, following what has happened in Ukraine, that we are standing together as Nato nations and there is no way that we would tolerate any attack on any one of our member states"", she said. Deployment imminent ""I think that's why it's so important that we have this partnership work now with the three Baltic states and Poland."" When questioned, a source close to Ms Griffiths said she was ""absolutely furious"" and ""livid"" about the intervention by Mr Corbyn's spokesman and that her support for Nato was a ""red line"". Asked about the reports earlier on Thursday, Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""I had a chat with Nia briefly last night and we are having a longer discussion later on today."" He told BBC Wales he wanted to see a ""de-escalation of tensions between Nato and Russia"", adding: ""I want to see a de-militarisation of the border between them. I'm sure everybody wants that, we don't want to see increased tensions."" The Labour leader said it was ""unfortunate that troops have gone up to the border on both sides"" and he wanted to see better relations between Russia, Nato and the EU. He said while he had ""many criticisms"" of Russia - its human rights record and of the bombing campaign in Syria - he said there had to be a relationship. ""I don't want to see any more troops deployed on the borders between Nato and Russia, I want to see a de-escalation, ultimately a de-militarisation and better relationships between both sides of it... there cannot be a return to a Cold War mentality."" In June 2015, RAF Typhoons, which have been deployed to the Baltic region each year since May 2014, were scrambled from Estonia to intercept and shadow two Russian military aircraft over the Baltic Sea. The Ministry of Defence announced last July that 500 UK troops would be permanently based in Estonia, that number being increased to about 800 in October. They are set to be deployed soon. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said the military build-up was intended to ""deter Russia from any further aggression"".

"input: The company said it had no plans to extend the network into the countryside, concentrating instead on expansion in towns and cities. The decision could ""exacerbate the rural-urban digital divide"", said the Country and Land Association (CLA). But a group that represents rural broadband providers was unsurprised. ""With £1.7bn of public funding going almost entirely through BT, it isn't surprising that an investment of this scale is focusing on areas that Virgin expects to see delivering better results,"" said Malcolm Corbett of the Independent Networks Co-operative Association. Virgin Media currently has five million customers and its latest investment, which it claims is the biggest in broadband infrastructure in the UK for more than a decade, is expected to extend its network from 13 million to 17 million homes. 'Look beyond cities' The CLA acknowledged it was not always profitable for private businesses to invest in remote areas. However, a spokesman said it was ""a pity that private companies are not putting the infrastructure in place to benefit rural business"". ""What is clear is that rural areas will not be able to access speeds in excess of 30Mbps or 50Mbps for some time to come. All this does is show that the rural economy is neglected once again,"" he added. Many rural business and families would like to be able take advantage of Virgin Media's Fibre to the Home technology, he said. ""BT's rollout of superfast broadband under the government's rural broadband programme relies on fibre to the cabinet (FTTC). This further disadvantages rural communities and businesses from effective connection speeds, because the further away a business is from the cabinet, the slower the speed."" Meanwhile the Countryside Alliance's head of policy, Sarah Lee, said it was ""disappointing that the improvements will not be seen in rural areas, but we welcome this challenge to BT's monopoly"". ""We hope this investment will encourage all broadband providers to look beyond the cityscape and invest in our countryside communities, to enable them to compete economically and socially in this digital world.""

"input: By Pedro GarciaBusiness reporter, Lisbon Luis Onofre openly admits that his first foray into luxury shoe design could have been his last. The Portuguese designer launched his first namesake collection in 1993, shortly after taking over his family's shoe factory. His father had warned him it wouldn't sell, and his dad was proved correct. Consumers weren't interested, and the shoes bombed. ""My lack of market knowledge was to blame,"" says the 49-year-old. ""It was heartbreaking, a big lesson for me. It was very humbling."" Today things are very different. Luis's glamorous designs are sold worldwide, and Michelle Obama, actress Naomi Watts, and socialite Paris Hilton are among his fans. He has also become a symbol of a recent renaissance in Portuguese shoemaking, helping to put the country firmly back on the haute couture map. Luis, who was born in Oliveira de Azemeis near Porto, in northern Portugal, grew up around shoes. His grandfather opened a footwear factory in the town in 1938, and the business has been been run by the family ever since. By the late 1980s, Luis's father was running the business, which was producing high-end shoes for French brands such as Cacharel and Galleries Lafayette. But when he asked Luis to join the company, the younger Onofre was reluctant, having set his heart on studying interior design. ""I remember seeing the stresses my parents brought home and thinking, 'I want to run away from that,'"" Luis recalls. He changed his mind, however, and took a degree in shoe design, before becoming managing director of the company in 1993. Keen to shake things up, he got the factory to start producing its own designs, not just those of other people. And the pain of seeing his first collection flop only made him more determined to reach his goal. ""I knew I wanted to do my own brand, but after my first attempt went wrong I decided to gain experience and resilience in the area. This sector is ever-changing, fashion changes, new technologies change all the time."" For the next six years he continued to make shoes for other brands, while honing his design ideas on the side. Finally his moment came in 1999 when he launched a 50-piece collection at Momad, a major shoe trade fair in Spain. Interest in the brand grew following big investments in marketing, and sales picked up. ""We started doing the shoe fair circuit, in Milan, Paris, Moscow,"" Luis says. ""Clients started requesting more exclusive designs. Our collections became more complex."" More The Boss features: Today he is best known for his women's shoes, which retail for around €300-€400 (£265-£355; $335-$445), and are all made in Portugal. His designs have been described as ""sexy"" and ""decadent"", and often incorporate elements such as Swarovski crystals or vertiginously high heels. Now based in Porto, the business turned over €8m last year, and employs 60 people across its commercial operations, factory and flagship stores. It also continues to make footwear for other brands such as Jimmy Choo and H&M. Despite his success, Luis has had to overcome other setbacks as a businessman, including an industry downturn in the 1990s. Portugal's shoe-making sector is centuries old, and considered on a par with Italy's and Spain's, despite being less well known. But in the late 1980s it was hit hard after Portugal joined the European Economic Community - the precursor to the European Union - in 1986, opening up the economy to foreign competition. The country's footwear industry wasn't ready for the change, and many factories had to close over the next decade. ""In the early 1990s, we lost almost all of the international clients we had,"" Luis recalls. Portugal's reputation for shoe making fell into decline, but Luis and other forward-thinking designers were determined to save it. ""We still had a generation of factory owners that did not understand contemporary fashion, or what was being sold internationally,"" he says. Over the past 20 years, however, he says a new wave of ""open-minded"" designers have brought fresh ideas to the table and turned things around. Portugal has regained its reputation for high-end design, factories have been retooled, and thousands of new jobs have been created. It's helped the country become a key player in the global shoe market, with exports totalling €1.8bn in 2019, up from €1.3bn in 2010. Paulo Goncalves, a spokesman for the Portuguese Footwear, Components and Leather Goods Manufacturers' Association, describes Luis as part of a ""fresh generation of designers"" that brought about change. ""Luis brought a new discourse to the shoe industry, putting talent and creativity at the forefront of an internationalisation strategy,"" he says. Luis's business still faces challenges, though. Shoemakers across Europe were already struggling with weaker consumer demand, and rising competition from China, when the coronavirus pandemic hit. Now the global luxury goods market is in a deep freeze. To help out during the global health crisis, Luis paused shoe production at his factory last month to instead make thousands of face masks that were donated to Portuguese citizens. Shoe manufacturing is now up and running again, and Luis is focusing on increasing online sales as physical stores around the world remain closed. He is also betting on a rebound in Asian markets that are further ahead in lifting Covid-19 restrictions.

Néhémie Joseph was found dead in his car with gunshot wounds on Thursday. Protesters are demanding Mr Moïse's resignation, blaming him for fuel shortages and worsening inflation. On Friday they burned tyres and spilled oil on the streets, chanting ""out with Jovenel"". Loudspeakers blasted music with anti-government lyrics. Other protesters tried to force their way through a cordon leading to Mr Moïse's residence. Police fired into the air and used tear gas to drive the crowd back. ""We are in misery and we are starving,"" said protester Claude Jean quoted by Reuters news agency. ""We cannot stand it any more. We ask (President Moïse) to resign so that we have a new Haiti... because we suffer too much in this country."" Earlier this year Mr Moïse rejected calls for his resignation, saying he would not leave the country in the ""hands of armed gangs and drug traffickers"". Néhémie Joseph was found dead in the town of Mirebalais, north-east of Port-au-Prince, but the circumstances are unclear. He had previously reported being threatened by politicians but it is not known if his work was the motive for the attack. Police say an investigation into the killing has been launched but have not given any further details.

"input: By Joe MillerBBC News, Frankfurt The gridiron streets that surround the now-iconic towers of Deutsche Bank, UBS and Commerzbank are eclipsed by layers of scaffolding. Meanwhile, giant orange cranes loom above the few green spaces that remain in the increasingly urbanised financial district. Despite its small size - it is home to under a million residents - and its unfair but unshakable reputation for being somewhat dull, Frankfurt is winning the battle for the spoils of Brexit Britain's economic heart; the City of London. Egged on by Germany's finance minister, Wolfgang Schaeuble, and enthusiastic emissaries from the state of Hesse, many of Europe's largest financial institutions have already announced their intention to relocate jobs here. Many banks' patience with the protracted Brexit negotiations, through which regulatory frameworks for foreign exchange trading and conditions for access to the Single Market must be thrashed out, seems to have run out. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Standard Chartered are among those who have chosen Frankfurt as their new European base, while others such as Goldman Sachs and UBS have promised to move thousands of jobs to the German hub. Predictions for the number of bankers set to descend on Frankfurt vary wildly, from tens of thousands, up to 100,000. Last week, a study by the WHU-Otto Beisheim management school suggested that the city could gain 10,000 new banking jobs and an extra 88,000 jobs in other sectors in Frankfurt and the surrounding Rhine-Main region. There have also been reports speculating that the city is fast running out of office space. Quite the contrary, says Oliver Schwebel, the man in charge of Frankfurt Economic Development, a city-backed body tasked with enticing companies to the area. ""We have a plan for 20 new skyscrapers,"" he says, surveying the ever-changing skyline of the city locals dub ""Mainhattan"". There is approximately a million square metres of office space in Frankfurt available for immediate occupancy, he says, and an extra 250,000 sq m will be available in the next few years. That's almost triple the current level of demand. Careful not to seem triumphant, Mr Schwebel adds that while there has undoubtedly been a boost in real-estate investment in anticipation of an exodus from the City of London, ""these are all plans from the last 10 or 15 years, nothing to do with Brexit"". Elvin Durakovic, a partner at estate agents Knight Frank, also downplays the supposed Frankfurt surge. ""Last year, when Brexit was announced, I got calls: 'Elvin, are you partying? Elvin, are you happy everyone is coming to Frankfurt?'"", he recalls. ""But unfortunately, it is not really the fact."" Although ""10 or 11"" companies with offices in the city have called to say they are double-sizing, ""the truth is people are coming, looking around, but not making decisions."" Part of this, says Mr Durakovic, is down to a reluctance to abandon the cosmopolitan British capital - where many bankers have built comfortable lives. ""No one is aware of what will happen in one or two years, what will be the result of Brexit, what payments they will be forced to make if they stay in London,"" he explains. ""They feel very comfortable in London, but they have to be prepared."" City and state officials balk at talk of a ""race"" for Brexit exiles; the somewhat undignified scramble for the business of the City of London is not in step with the self-assured image Frankfurt prefers to project. But representatives have nonetheless been employing the ""hard sell"". A recent video campaign produced by the German government as part of its bid for Frankfurt to host the European Banking Authority - filled with shots of millennials skating and surfboarding to a pulsating soundtrack - looks more like a chart-topping music video than a policy proposal. And as Mr Schwebel is keen to point out, Frankfurt has a lot going for it: its manageable size, its largely English-speaking population, its convenient air and rail connections, and its family-friendly suburbia. For bankers, its favourable time zone also allows for a ""never-ending day"": Asian markets can be serviced in the morning, the US in the evenings. Then there is the price. ""Here we are talking about 38.50 euros (£35) a square metre a month,"" says Knight Frank's Elvin Durakovic, referring to the cost of office space. ""In London it is approximately double"". Yet Frankfurt's pole position in the post-Brexit contest is largely down to pure convenience - most banks are already in the city, all they need to do is expand. They won't be doing so without some local consternation. Rolf Janssen, a veteran of the local Mieterschutzverein, a tenant's rights agency representing some 20,000 renters in the Frankfurt area, is concerned that the city - already one of the costliest in Germany - will become even more expensive for those not on the high salaries that are common in the financial services industry. Half of Frankfurt's inhabitants earn an average of 2,000 euros a month, while rent for a modest flat can be around 1,200 or 1,300, he explains. ""Thousands of people will come who have a lot of money,"" he says of the anticipated post-Brexit influx. ""This is a very difficult situation. It used to be difficult for students or temp workers [to afford rent], but now it's a problem for regular employees, and the middle class."" Crucially, higher rents affect the Mietspiegel, or rental index, which is compiled by calculating average property prices for the previous four years, and used to regulate the rental market. Nonetheless, Mr Janssen is keen to point out that he's not suggesting UK workers be prevented from coming to the German financial capital. ""It is very important that so many British bankers are coming to Frankfurt,"" he says. ""We don't live in the middle ages, so we can't say this is a castle and we keep the drawbridge up."" Instead, the Mieterschutzverein wants to see more investment in affordable public housing - an issue that is already a talking point in the upcoming federal elections. For city administrators, meanwhile, the lack of clarity on numbers is proving to be a planning headache. ""If 10,000 people show up in one year do we have space? Absolutely not,"" says Paul Fochtman, the head of Frankfurt International School, which educates many of the children of those who work in the city's skyscrapers. The institution is bracing for a surge in pupils, but determining the capacity required is an impossible task. ""We ask 'how many are you bringing' and [the banks] say 'we can't tell you that yet',"" says Mr Fochtman, betraying some frustration. ""They are certainly coming - no question,"" he adds. ""But how many and how quickly, that remains elusive"".

"input: Dumfries and Galloway was hit by winds gusting up to 77mph and significant coastal problems last week. The local authority has asked the public to send in images of the flooding experienced at the time. It said that would help improve its warning system by using evidence of ""what actually happened"" across south west Scotland. Anybody with photographs has been asked to send them to the council with details of when and where they were taken.

"input: By Jean MackenzieNewsbeat reporter The new independent section has been brought in to test candidates' navigation skills and make the tests more like real driving. Learners will have to follow road signs or a series of directions rather than being told where and when to turn. The new practical standard also applies to the motorcycle module two test and to the LGV test. Chris Nelson, 18, from Hampshire agreed to try it out to see how it compares with the old one. He originally passed last year with a few minor faults and said he found it quite easy. ""The manoeuvres were hard but my driving instructor had prepared me well,"" he said. 'Likely to fail' Once in the car, Chris was told to follow signs to Stanmore, northwest London, for 10 minutes without asking for help. He managed OK but said he found it hard because there was a lot to think about at the same time. ""You do have to look at the signs and it does take you away from concentrating on your driving,"" he admitted. ""If I had had that as my driving test a year ago I think I would have got more flustered, which would have made me more likely to fail."" One of the reasons the new test has been brought in is because the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) found new drivers were struggling to find their way around after they had passed. Pass Rates Chris thinks the independent driving will make things easier in the long run. ""People drive to different destinations all the time and they need to know how to get there. ""But if you have just started it will be harder and you will probably have to have more lessons."" The DSA says it does not expect there to be a big drop in the pass rate and that drivers shouldn't need any more lessons. Chris's examiner Cheryl also thought it would also be quite straightforward. ""Now that instructors know this is going to be included it will be quite easy for them to prepare their pupils,"" she said.

"input: Among them was a businessman who Jan Kuciak said had links to the mafia and contacts with figures close to Prime Minister Robert Fico, reports say. Police suspect the murder of 27-year-old Kuciak and his partner Martina Kusnirova was a contract killing. His story on the alleged corruption was published posthumously on Wednesday. Raids and detentions were being carried out in several places in eastern Slovakia, police chief Tibor Gaspar said, without giving details. Antonino Vadala, who owns several companies, and several relatives were among those taken into custody, local media report. In his investigation, Kuciak alleged that Italian businessmen with ties to the feared Calabrian organised crime syndicate 'Ndrangheta - including Mr Vadala - had settled in eastern Slovakia, and spent years embezzling EU funds for this relatively poor region on the border with Ukraine These men, he said, had cultivated business links with senior officials, including people close to Mr Fico. Two of them - chief state adviser Maria Troskova and national security council secretary Viliam Jasan - resigned from their posts. They denied any involvement in the killing and said they were stepping down so their names could not be used in a political battle against Mr Fico. Hundreds of people joined a protest called by the opposition in the capital Bratislava on Wednesday, and a another rally has been called by students on Friday. Kuciak had been working for Aktuality.sk, an online unit of Swiss and German-owned publisher Ringier Axel Springer, for three years. This is the first killing of a journalist in Slovakia's history. Mr Fico has offered a €1m ($1.2m; £890,000) reward for anyone who comes forward with information about the case.

"input: Only 25 new pitches have been created in the county since 2012, with more than 130 still needed, according to previous council calculations. A list of potential sites was due to be published in 2018 but was delayed by the merger of nine councils into two. National charity Friends Families and Travellers has described the continued delay as a ""shocking disgrace"". Dorset Council and Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council, which suspended all cabinet meetings in response to the coronavirus pandemic last month, said a separate plan for Gypsy and traveller sites was no longer being progressed. Instead, provision would be covered within two new local plans for those areas. A consultation on Dorset Council's plan is due in the autumn with a draft plan expected to be published in autumn next year, submitted in spring 2022 and adopted the following year. 'Stark inequalities' BCP council said it anticipated a public consultation on its draft local plan would take place later this year, with further consultation in 2021 and adoption in 2022. Sarah Mann, director of Friends Families and Travellers, said: ""Proposing to not make any progress until after 2022 is a shocking disgrace."" She said the restructuring of Dorset councils in April 2019 was not relevant to the ""stark inequalities"" experienced by Gypsy and traveller communities and said the situation demonstrated the authorities' ""lack of commitment to meet their legal obligations"". ""Gypsies, Roma and Travellers have been a vital part of Dorset history for hundreds of years,"" she said. The first stage of consultation on possible sites across the county was held in 2011. The following year the government agreed there was a national need for about 6,000 new pitches. But a BBC Freedom of Information (FOI) request in 2016 found local authorities had created just 1,800 since that time. It found there were 212 pitches in Dorset, with 25 created since 2012, all in Piddlehinton and only available during the spring and summer months. The county's councils had also calculated 132 more were needed. In 2015, about 80% of respondents to a Gypsy and traveller site consultation in Dorset raised objections, including highlighting concerns over flooding. A recent FOI request to Dorset's councils found they dealt with about 40 unauthorised encampments every year and they previously said they had spent more than £700,000 on associated removal and clean-up costs since 2012.

"input: In April a UK team of archaeologists excavated the Castletown cellar where the vessel 'Peggy' had been stored for 120 years in the Isle of Man. According to Manx National Heritage, it was built for politician and bank owner George Quayle between 1789 and 1793. Alison Fox of MNH said the sandbags will protect ""venerable timbers"". During the excavations more than 50 tonnes of 19th Century landfill were removed from under Mr Quayle's former Castletown home. Rather than the expected slipway, a beautifully constructed dock was discovered, which would have enabled Mr Quayle to float her gently in and out of the boathouse in the late 1700s. The removal of ground however left part of the dock vulnerable to the sea that still fills and empties the dock each day. Volunteers from the Civil Defence have now built the wall of sandbags to protect the timbers until they can be further examined. Ms Fox said it was a ""daunting task with with numerous logistical challenges"". ""The sandbag wall will protect the fragile gates over the coming winter and help ensure the protection of this unique part of the Island's maritime heritage"". After Mr Quayle's death, the boat was locked away for almost 120 years, until it was rediscovered in 1935. Edmund Southworth, of Manx National Heritage (MNH), said ""Internationally, Peggy is quite simply one of the world's oldest yachts to survive."" MNH is currently embarking on a five-year programme to remove, conserve and study the vessel. It is thought the boat was used by Mr Quayle for leisure purposes and to carry important mail to Liverpool.

"input: Three political groups backed by the brothers say they will use advertising, lobbying and grassroots campaigns to push the benefits of free trade. The duo run Koch Industries, one of the world's largest privately owned firms. The move comes just days after Mr Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico. On Tuesday, the company was told that David Koch, 78, was stepping down because of his deteriorating health. In a letter, Charles Koch, 82, told employees he was ""deeply saddened"" about his brother's departure, adding that ""David has always been a fighter and is dealing with this challenge in the same way"". The three Koch-backed groups launching the campaign against Mr Trump's tariffs: Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce, Americans for Prosperity and the LIBRE Initiative, are urging the president to lift the recent tariffs on aluminium and steel imports as well as the proposed tariffs on other imports from China. Americans for Prosperity president Tim Phillips said the tariffs would ""hamstring our full economic potential"". ""There are better ways to negotiate trade deals than by punishing American consumers and businesses with higher costs,"" he added. The campaign indicates the level of concern among business groups, typically Republican supporters, about the impact of the tariffs. Leaders from the EU, Canada and Mexico have criticised the move and threatened retaliation, sparking fears of a trade war. On Tuesday, Mexico imposed a wide range of new tariffs on US goods, including steel, pork, and bourbon. Donald Trump has said the steel tariffs will protect US steelmakers, which he says are vital to national security. Republican cash machine takes on Trump Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington The Koch network of political organisations has been a reliable cash machine for Republicans for more than a decade. When Donald Trump became the party's nominee, the spigot to conservative candidates continued to flow - although the primary focus of the conservative brothers were congressional candidates and not the top of the ticket. Since Mr Trump's surprise victory, Charles and David Koch have sought common ground with the president, particularly on tax reform, but they continue to be far from ideological soul mates. Now, as the president bangs the drums of a trade war, the relations between the libertarian-leaning billionaires and the populist-nationalist president are becoming increasingly frayed. It's not full political warfare yet, however. The advertising and advocacy campaign proposed by the Koch groups tilts in the direction of ""friendly advice"" for the president, not hostile criticism. When paired with congressional efforts to curtail the president's ability to enact new tariffs, however, and the stakes increase. The Republican party has long been a welcoming home to free trade advocates, who point to the economic benefits of globalism and international competition. Mr Trump is trying to change that - but he's picking a fight with some very deep-pocketed adversaries. Who are the Koch brothers? Charles and David Koch's company - the second largest privately owned business in the US - has interests ranging from pipelines to paper towels. According to Forbes Magazine, each of the men are worth about $60bn (£45bn), and are tied for eighth richest man in the US. According to the Koch Industries website, they have more than 120,000 employees between all their businesses and subsidiaries. They have previously put money into groups denying climate change and attacking unions and workers' rights. But they have also pushed for criminal justice reform and made large donations to the American Civil Liberties Union. Last November, the brothers helped fund Meredith Corporation's deal to buy US magazine publisher Time Inc. But to many Americans, they are known more for their political activism than their corporate brands. The brothers are political mega-donors who have spent millions of dollars on supporting conservative policies, particularly causes that seek to roll back regulations. In 1980, David Koch ran as a vice-presidential candidate of the Libertarian Party.

"input: The blast in Leicester on 25 February destroyed a supermarket and the flat above it where a family lived. A court heard shop worker Viktorija Ijevleva ""knew too much"" about the plot and was left to die in the fire. Aram Kurd, Hawkar Hassan and Arkan Ali deny conspiring to commit fraud and charges of murder and manslaughter. Mary Ragoobar and two of her sons, Shane and Sean Ragoobeer, were killed along with Shane's girlfriend, Leah Reek, in their flat above the Zabka Polish shop on Hinckley Road. The third son survived after he was pulled from the rubble. The boys' father was at work at the time. Prosecutor David Herbert QC told Leicester Crown Court that Miss Ijevleva, who was Mr Ali's girlfriend, assisted the defendants in obtaining insurance for the shop but was left to die in the explosion because she ""knew too much"". ""The explosion they caused was created with an intention to kill,"" he told the jury. Mr Herbert added: ""It is also clear that they knew that people would be in the flat at the time of the explosion. It was, after all, early on a Sunday evening. ""You may think that fact simply didn't bother the defendants."" He said the ""massive"" explosion was so loud ""some in the neighbourhood thought that it was a bomb"" and so powerful ""it demolished the entire building and killed five people who were inside"". Jurors were also told Mr Hassan was caught on CCTV buying 26.6 litres of unleaded petrol in a drum, which an analyst said matched a drum found at the scene of the explosion. Commenting on the amount of fuel bought, Mr Herbert said ""an average car takes 50 litres"". Mr Herbert showed jurors CCTV and mobile footage of the explosion in which a loud boom could be heard. ""It was an explosion the prosecution say was caused by many, many litres of petrol,"" he said. ""The explosion and fire that followed was deliberately caused by these three defendants as part of a plan to profit from a false insurance claim for loss of stock, contents and future loss of business from the shop that was on the ground floor. ""The evidence indicates that had the crime been successful the insurance claim would have been in the region of £300,000. ""It boils down to greed."" Mr Kurd, 34, of Hillary Place in Leicester, Mr Hassan, 33, of no fixed address, and Mr Ali, 37, of Drake Close in Oldham, each deny five charges of murder, five charges of manslaughter and a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation.

"input: Sheffield council is severing ties with developer Hammerson after the company failed to deliver the £400m Sevenstone scheme in the city centre. The council had intended to continue with the scheme and find a new developer but it has now decided to go back to the drawing board. Hammerson has said ending its work with the council had been a mutual decision. New plans are expected to be unveiled by next spring. The council said it had set a target for completion of the scheme during the 2018/19 financial year. 'Decisive action' The development, currently called New Retail Quarter, will cover the same area as the Sevenstone proposal, between Barker's Pool, The Moor and Wellington Street. Councillor Leigh Bramall, cabinet member for business, skills and development at the city council, said: ""We are taking decisive and clear action to deliver a New Retail Quarter for Sheffield. ""We will bring a brand new scheme forward for the people of Sheffield, a high-class regional shopping and leisure facility that would compete with other city centres such as Manchester, Leeds and Nottingham."" The council is seeking a new development partner or investor for the scheme and said it had already been approached by several companies. Peter Cole, Hammerson's chief investment officer, said: ""We have worked very hard to achieve a retail scheme which creates a thriving city centre environment in Sheffield. We believe the city can build on our work to date.""

"input: By Reality CheckBBC News The Palestinian territories have only recently started receiving supplies of vaccines, while Israel has surged ahead with its vaccination programme. Who is Israel vaccinating? Israel is the leading nation globally for the number of doses per head of population, with more than 108 doses given out for every 100 people. Israel started easing lockdown restrictions in February as studies showed the effectiveness of its vaccination campaign in preventing hospitalisations and deaths. It recently began vaccinating Palestinians who come to work in Israel or in Israeli settlements in the West Bank. There are around 133,000 workers, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, with many crossing over to Israel from the West Bank on a daily basis. In occupied East Jerusalem, all Palestinians are entitled to be vaccinated by Israel, as are medics working at the six Palestinian hospitals there - many of whom come from other parts of the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians in East Jerusalem have Israeli residency status - so those living there pay Israeli taxes and have access to Israeli health insurance. What's happening in other Palestinian areas? In the West Bank and Gaza - home to an estimated five million people and regarded as occupied territories by the international community - the vaccination programme has barely got going. Since early February there has been a sharp rise in infections and a five-day lockdown has been imposed across the West Bank from 15 March. World Health Organization (WHO) data shows that there have so far been more than 236,500 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than than 2,500 deaths among Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem. The case fatality rate for these areas is 1.1% - that's the proportion of reported infections which result in a person dying. In Israel, it is 0.7%, according to the WHO. The Palestinian Ministry of Health - which operates in the West Bank - says it has deals with four companies that will provide enough vaccines for 70% of its people. A delivery of 10,000 doses of Russian-made vaccine has arrived, 2,000 of which have been sent on to Gaza. Gaza has also received 20,000 Russian vaccine doses donated by the UAE. Getting vaccines to Gaza is faced with the logistical challenges of the restrictions imposed on the area, which has been under blockade by Israel and Egypt since the militant Islamist movement Hamas took charge there in 2007. A report by the World Bank says that the Palestinians will need more financial and logistical help in order to cover 60% of the population. It has urged Israel to consider donating extra doses it has ordered but does not need to the Palestinians. Israel says it is giving 5,000 doses to the Palestinians, two thousand of which have been delivered to the West Bank so far. What about vaccines from the Covax scheme? The international Covax scheme, backed by the WHO, should cover up to 20% of vaccine requirements for the Palestinians. This is a global effort to get vaccines to poorer countries, which may not be able to secure enough supplies on their own. Covax has said that the West Bank and Gaza would get an initial 240,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, and 37,440 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, but these have not yet arrived. Whose responsibility is it to vaccinate Palestinians? The United Nations (UN) human rights body has released a statement saying it's Israel's responsibility to provide equitable access to Covid-19 vaccines for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. The body says differential access is ""morally and legally"" unacceptable under international law laid out in the Geneva Conventions on the regulation of occupied territories. But Israeli health minister, Yuli Edelstein, told the BBC: ""We can also look into the so-called Oslo agreements where it says loud and clear that the Palestinians have to take care of their own health."" The Oslo accords - which Israel signed with the Palestine Liberation Organisation - give the Palestinian Authority oversight of public health under the principles of self-determination. But the Palestinian authorities point to another part of those accords which says: ""Israel and the Palestinian side shall exchange information regarding epidemics and contagious diseases, shall co-operate in combating them and shall develop methods for [the] exchange of medical files and documents."" The Oslo accords, agreed in 1993 and 1995, set out how parts of the West Bank and Gaza would be governed under an interim framework until a permanent peace settlement can be reached. But UN experts say international law takes priority over these accords. They say - despite Israel's position on the issue - the Fourth Geneva Convention is specific about the duty of the occupying power to provide healthcare.

"input: According to a mid-term review of UNICEF ,the UN agency for children, LTTE has recruited 488 children while releasing 449 during the first six months of the year. UNICEF said that despite promises to refrain from recruiting children 1300 children remained with the Tigers. In some cases recruitment has been done forcibly and on a number of occasions children have been removed from there homes violently. Continued recruitment of child soldiers has made it difficult for families to access projects set up for children by UNICEF. UNICEF repeats its call to immediately cease all recruitment of children and it further emphasises that the suspension of peace talks has fuelled recruitment initiatives. The LTTE has always denied forcible child soldier recruitment and says that it only uses children for political and administrative work. According to the LTTE children who do not have other alternatives to make a living are compelled to join the them. However the LTTE has been widely criticised by the international al community for not keep its promise to refrain from child solider recruitment. The European Union last month urged the LTTE to keep to its promise and immediately stop recruiting children for combat purposes.

Phil Noake, Didcot A's station manager, called it a ""very sad time for everyone at the power station"". Nine months of decommissioning begins on 31 March, with demolition of the six towers expected to take several years. The station was disconnected from the national grid at 14:00 GMT. Former power station worker Lyn Bowen, who originally connected Didcot to the national grid in 1970, returned to the plant to flick the switch to disconnect. 'Crunch point' Mr Noake said: ""I would like to thank the teams who have helped to deliver power to homes and businesses across Britain for over 40 years. ""We would like to extend our thanks to the local community who have supported us throughout these years."" Greenpeace campaigner Ben Stewart, who climbed the towers in 2006, said it marked the beginning of the end of coal burning in the UK. He added: ""Off shore wind is where we should be focusing, given Britain is the Saudi Arabia of wind, and we should grasp the opportunity to make a huge investment there. ""We're the last generation that can do something about climate change. We're right at the crunch point."" Country Life readers voted the landmark Britain's third worst eyesore in 2003.

"input: By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Arts Correspondent Ms Merkel has been named the magazine's 'Person of the Year' and Davidson's portrait adorns the cover of the world-famous publication. He did not meet her in person but took inspiration from photos and footage. The Belfast-born artist told the BBC that the invitation from Time was ""something you don't turn down"". ""I'm sitting in my studio looking at the actual painting, and to see it reproduced on the cover of Time at this time of year and online worldwide is a remarkable thing,"" he said. The artist, whose striking portraits can currently be seen in Belfast's Lyric theatre and in the Ulster Museum among many other places, said he was initially a little worried as it was not possible to get a sitting with Ms Merkel. ""All of my paintings, to date, have been the result of meeting and spending time with the person I've painted. ""With this particular commission I was told that the likeness was going to have to be gained through photographic source. ""But I decided to rise to the challenge."" Davidson immersed himself in finding out about his subject, studying photographs and film and reading books about Ms Merkel. 'Empathy and compassion' The process took about six weeks from start to finish, whereas he usually works on a portrait for about six months. ""I love nothing more than sitting in my studio and making work, so I just had to focus completely. ""I always paint my sitters in a very natural light. So I actually had to go back into my archive of personal sitters and look at how the light worked on their faces, so I used lots of my own sources from my studio as well as photographic sources for the portrait."" Davidson said that while he did not actually meet Ms Merkel, he felt that by painting her, he did get to know her. ""What I wanted to bring out was something that photography has never caught: a sense of compassion, dignity and humanity. ""I'm thinking particularly of her stance this year."" ""What I wanted to do was to portray that, so that whenever people looked at her face and looked into her eyes in the portrait a sense of empathy and compassion would come through."" He found out on Wednesday afternoon that his portrait was on the cover of Time, being seen by people right across the world. Mrs Merkel has not yet been in contact with the artist, but he said he would ""jump at"" an opportunity to meet the chancellor.

"input: Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter But the widespread nature of allegations of bullying and harassment was genuinely shocking when it emerged, as was the nature of some what we heard. The scandal ended the cabinet careers of Damian Green and Michael Fallon. MPs vowed never again. Many months later, Parliament, led by Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, who has been pushing a cross-party effort to clean up the mess, is about to publish its proposals for change. There are already worries that the changes simply don't go far enough as my colleagues at Newsnight, who have done so much to reveal what's being going on, have discovered. Many months on I spoke to three of the young activists who were brave enough to go public with their allegations at the time. And they are frustrated. They have supported the process that Parliament has been pursuing but were deeply sceptical about whether anything would actually change. Depressingly, they told me that since they went public, others have confided in them about bullying or harassment by other MPs, sometimes frontbenchers, but are still too scared to come forward. James Greenhalgh, who alleged that he had been sexually assaulted while working as an intern, told me there were ""forces trying to scupper the system"". He told me it felt like ""when allegations emerged, the tide went out and exposed the nasty rock pools but the tide has come back in and no-one is acting because they can't see it"". Kate Maltby, whose allegations led to the resignation of Theresa May's number two, Damian Green said, ""everyone is looking away, because it's like expenses, if you dig too closely, everyone thinks they could lose"". Ava Etemadzadeh, whose complaint against a Labour MP is still being investigated months on, said the proposals being put forward by Parliament were welcome, but too little too late. You can hear the three of them reflecting together on what's happened since on the Today programme. And from Andrea Leadsom who, despite some resistance in Parliament, is determined to push the proposals forward and win the vote next Thursday. That's when we'll know if Parliament is genuinely determined at least to begin a clean up when MPs vote to approve, or reject, those cross-party proposals. Whether the testimonies of those who risked their own reputations will be forgotten, or provide the script for change.

"input: Critics say some of the projects ""launched"" by the president were already under way or had already been commissioned. Some others have been viewed as not meriting the weight of presidential publicity. Last week, Mr Kenyatta, who faces elections in August, was in the city of Mombasa where he launched a footbridge, proudly described as a ""non-motorized transport project"". Some Twitter users have taken this as a cue to mock the president. Using the hashtag #UhuruChallenge, they posted their own examples of things they were ""launching"" or ""commissioning"". Some parts of Kenya, including the capital, Nairobi, coastal and northern regions have been suffering power outages since the weekend because of a technical problem at a power station. Perhaps inevitably, this provided another opportunity for satirical digs at Mr Kenyatta. And one user thought Kenyans were unlikely to have heard the last of unimpressive presidential launches.

The bank raised interest rates by 0.25% for the first time in nine years in December. In her prepared testimony, Ms Yellen said: ""Financial conditions in the United States have recently become less supportive of growth, with declines in broad measures of equity prices, higher borrowing rates for riskier borrowers and a further appreciation of the dollar. ""Against this backdrop, the [Federal Reserve] Committee expects that with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in coming years and that labour market indicators will continue to strengthen."" 'Intensified uncertainty' Ms Yellen added China's ""unclear"" currency policy was fuelling global stock market volatility. She said the decline in China's currency, the yuan, had ""intensified uncertainty about China's exchange rate policy and the prospects for its economy"". ""This uncertainty led to increased volatility in global financial markets and, against the background of persistent weakness abroad, exacerbated concerns about the outlook for global growth."" While she said she was confident China's economy was not facing a ""hard landing"", Ms Yellen said the overall uncertainty created by the world's second-largest economy was behind some of the steep falls in global commodity prices, which in turn were creating stress for exporting nations. Ms Yellen added that ""low commodity prices could trigger financial stresses in commodity-exporting economies"" as well as in commodity-producing firms around the world. If such problems materialised, she added, ""foreign activity and demand for US exports could weaken and financial market conditions could tighten further"". In response to the comments, Brian Jacobson from Wells Fargo Asset Management said: ""I think she pushed out the next rate hike. ""Until there is stability in the price of oil and the value of the dollar, I wouldn't expect much more action out of the Fed,"" he told Reuters. Deutsche Bank economists said in a note: ""In our view, her comments take a March rate hike off the table, while retaining the option to potentially raise rates later this year"". Defending Fed policy Following her prepared testimony Ms Yellen responded to questions in Congress about the new way in which the central bank implemented its last rate rise. Congress is concerned the new policy benefits the country's banks more than the American public, because banks receive a higher interest rate on the reserves they hold at the Fed. Supporters of the interest rate on excess reserves (IOER) policy say it allows the central bank to maintain control of the market. Ms Yellen has called the policy a ""traditional tool"" for adjusting rates, citing its use by other central banks around the globe. The Fed was given the power to offer IOER by Congress in 2006. Stock market turmoil US stock markets opened higher after the comments. Recent stock market turmoil has prompted most Wall Street analysts to push back their forecast of when the next US Federal Reserve interest rate rise will occur, from March to June at the earliest. US stock markets have taken a battering in recent weeks over concerns caused by the economic slowdown in China, which has in turn led to lower commodity and oil prices, while the weaker yuan has made Chinese exports cheaper than those from the US. The Dow Jones is down some 8.5% since the start of the year, the S&P 500 is down more than 9% since 1 January and the Nasdaq is lower by 14%. US economic growth in the last three months of 2015 also slowed dramatically, to 0.7% compared with the same period a year earlier, falling from 2% three months earlier.

"input: Shell's profit for the three months to June came in at $8bn (£4.9bn) on a current cost of supplies basis, up from $4.5bn in the same period last year. Though oil and gas production was 2% lower than the same quarter in 2010, the company said it had benefited from asset sales in the first half of 2011. Earlier this week, rival BP announced second-quarter profits of $5.3bn. On Thursday, larger US rival Exxon Mobil said that net profit rose 41% to $10.7bn for the three months to June from the same period last year. New projects The price of oil is much higher now than it was a year ago, in part inflated by political unrest in oil-producing countries such as Libya. Twelve months ago, US light sweet crude oil was trading at about $78 a barrel. It is currently trading at about $97 a barrel, having topped $110 at the end of April. Shell also said it had sold $4bn of non-core assets in the first six months of the year, which was a ""key driver"" to reducing costs and improving its operating performance. However, like BP, Shell's production was down in the second quarter year-on-year, due to field sales and warm weather which hit European gas demand. But the company said it had started three large-scale projects this year that would add to its oil production by over 400,000 barrels per day. These are a Canadian oil sands venture and two gas plants in Qatar, in which it has invested $30bn. ""We have made important progress with new production in 2011, and the ramp-up of our new projects should drive our financial performance in the coming quarters,"" said Shell chief executive Peter Voser.

"input: Greg Barker dismissed claims that a law to secure the barrage could be passed before the next general election. He said the company behind the scheme, from the Vale of Glamorgan to Somerset, must provide more information before the UK government could support it. Hafren Power said it had submitted a 150-page business case and that it was disappointed by the criticism. The barrage would be constructed over 18km (11 miles) between Lavernock Point and Weston-super-Mare. Backers say it would mean jobs and help tackle climate change, but opponents say it would harm the environment. Objectors also say it would endanger wildlife and that the costs outweigh the benefits. Mr Barker was giving evidence to MPs on the Energy and Climate Change Committee. One committee member, Labour MP John Robertson, said the amount of information provided by Hafren Power, the company behind the Severn barrage proposal, was ""embarrassing"". He told the minister: ""I'm surprised you haven't just thrown it out completely"". Mr Barker agreed with the committee chair, Conservative MP Tim Yeo, that ""some pretty big questions remain insufficiently answered"". Mr Yeo said it would be in Hafren Power's interests to be more transparent about what it was proposing. Mr Barker said it had presented his department with an outline proposal case but he said ministers were not sitting on a great deal of information. He held up Hafren Power's executive summary which ran to only a few pages of A4 paper. He said the proposed Severn barrage could be a very significant asset for the UK. 'Listening mode' ""However, the information that the department has seen so far doesn't allow us to assess if the proposal is credible, nor if it could actually stand a chance of achieving the benefits Hafren Power claims the scheme would achieve,"" he said. ""There are a number of issues that Hafren Power would need to explore in much greater detail before we could take a view as to whether their proposal warrants further interest from government."" He said Hafren Power needed to show that the project would tackle environmental challenges, work to mitigate the negative impact on the local economy such as Bristol Port and - most importantly - provide evidence the project is affordable and represents good value for electricity consumers. The company had yet to provide details on the design of turbines which meant the government could not have a view on the scheme's ecological impact or its cost. Mr Barker also played down suggestions that a meeting with Prime Minister David Cameron last year suggested there was momentum behind the project. He said that view may rely on a partial account of the meeting, where Mr Cameron was ""very much in listening mode"". He said Hafren Power's evidence was not sufficiently compelling, but the government had left the door open for that to change. A form of legislation known as a hybrid bill would be needed before the scheme can go ahead. 'Confusion and division' Asked if it was realistic to suggest a bill could pass before the next general election in 2015, the minister said: ""Not at all."" Neath MP Peter Hain, who is campaigning for the barrage, said later: 'If we're now unlikely to see the hybrid bill required for the Severn barrage in this parliament that will mean two more years delay for a gigantic £25bn investment creating 50,000 desperately needed jobs. ""Sadly, confusion and division in government now means we're working to a longer timescale."" Mr Hain, a former Welsh Secretary, said the minister's ""curious statement"" was at variance with constructive meetings he had had with other ministers, including David Cameron. A spokesman for Hafren Power said: ""We are pleased to see the Department of Energy is keeping an open mind on the project, but disappointed at the criticism of lack of detail when it has, for example, a new 150-page business case from us. ""However, we'll keep working with the government to supply answers and secure support to proceed.""

"input: By Lucy ToddEntertainment reporter Jack and Dani have been crowned the Love Island 2018 series winners and are set to walk off happily ever after into the Balearic sunset (after it's been Instagrammed first, obvs), with their £50,000 spoils and dignity intact. As the sun goes down on this year's Love Island, we look back at the series' defining moments. 1. Hayley's Brexit chat A major political summit took place earlier this summer, featuring heavily in the news. There has been plenty of reporting on who's in, who's out and what aspects of trade and travel will be affected. No, not Theresa May's Chequers meeting, but the Love Island girls chatting Brexit. An early series highlight came when Hayley Hughes admitted she ""didn't have a clue"" what Brexit was. Trying to explain, Georgia says: ""Welfare, and like things we trade with would be cut down."" Confused perhaps by the cutting down comment, Hayley responds: ""So does that mean we won't have any trees?"" ""Cheese?"" says Samira, adding to the general farce of the conversation. ""Why wouldn't we have trees?"" chimes in Dani. Things finally take a serious turn for Hayley when it's mooted that it may become more difficult for Brits to travel abroad. ""So it would be harder to go on holidays?"" says Hayley. ""Oh, I love my holidays!"" This Brexit thingy is serious stuff indeed. 2. Rosie confronting Adam One of the first truly explosive scenes came when Rosie Williams confronted Adam Collard over the way he had treated her following the arrival of newcomer Zara McDermott. After spending 10 days coupled up, Rosie told Adam he had ""hurt her"" and broken her heart, after ignoring her all day. Adam denied he'd done anything wrong and generally looked smug during the whole conversation. Cue Adam becoming public enemy number one - even prompting charity Women's Aid to issue a warning about his emotional abuse and gaslighting behaviour towards both Rosie and Kendall. 3. Georgia: she's loyal, babe If you didn't know after the (approximate) 2,643 times she mentioned it, Georgia is loyal. Babe. She even mentioned it four times back-to-back, so it must be true. Speaking - as she's cracking on with Idris - she says: ""Obviously I am very loyal. I'm a very loyal girl. Very loyal. And when I am with someone, I am completely loyal unless I am honest with them, tell them how I feel, then I crack on."" Got it? Even during one of the other biggest moments of the series, when she may or may not have planted THAT KISS on Jack Fowler, she was - of course - still loyal. And that cheeky little peck went on to cause more trouble than it could possibly have been worth. Laura broke up with Jack (for not being loyal); Georgia and Laura fell out (over Laura questioning G's loyalty); and Ellie and Georgia had a bitter kitchen exchange (with Ellie claiming Georgia was, in fact, NOT loyal. Gasp!) In the words of Dua Lipa: One kiss is all it takes. 4. Dani shown footage of Jack at Casa Amor One of the biggest - and most complained about - must-see moments on television this year was the moment Dani saw footage of boyfriend Jack in Casa Amor with his ex Ellie. Dyer burst into tears at the video and took to the Love Island beach hut to share her agony. ""I just knew it was too good to be true,"" she sobbed. But the scenes sparked more than 2,600 complaints to Ofcom, as many thought the video Dyer was shown was misleading. In reality, Jack had also taken his bedding outside into the garden because he refused to share a bed with another girl, and told Adam he was in love with Dyer - but these excerpts had not been shown to her. Safe to say, they were happily reunited and it all turned out right in the end. 5. Megan: 'Kiss me' Megan played with fire when she entreated Wes to kiss her while he was still coupled up with Laura. In so doing, all manner of rules from the girl code could be heard smashing. To his credit, Wes didn't cheat on Laura, but told her he'd be ""getting to know Megan a whole lot more"" following the conversation. Understandably, Laura and Meg never really saw eye to eye afterwards. 6. The impressions In a scene that could have come straight from Emmerdale, the boys offered some light relief from all the drama when, out of nowhere, they all pretended to be from Yorkshire for a whole conversation. A sign of cabin fever perhaps, but it had us in hysterics. Likewise, Jack proved he was a dab hand at doing impressions of his fellow Islanders - with his and Dani's take-off of Eyal a real highlight. 7. Samira's shock exit Hitherto unlucky-in-love Samira finally found her Prince Charming in Frankie, but was left bereft when he was voted off the show. She told her fellow Islanders: ""So, these past couple of days I haven't been myself and I've struggled to be happy in here and have fun and I had a taste of what I've wanted and it's gone."" So off she skipped out of the villa's front door in a tiny fuchsia bikini with her enormous suitcase. Wonder what airport security made of her outfit? 8. Charlie asking Ellie to be his girlfriend There was a lot of asking to be each other's significant others in the series. But the hands down most inventive example goes to Charlie Brake, who pulled off a master plan in cahoots with Wes, Jack Fincham and Alex. Operation Chellie involved derring-do in the guise of covert use of a lipstick, strategic spillage of red wine and copious usage of the word ""muggy"". One ""I've never been so shocked in my life"" and a ""yes"" later from Ellie and they had all jumped in the pool. Romeo done. 9. Dr Alex's Daddy day care disaster When tasked with the baby challenge, Dr Alex showed he wasn't quite cut out for fatherhood yet. During the task, in which the Islanders were given a baby doll to care for, the A&E doctor catapulted himself and his baby onto the floor during an impromptu buggy race with Jack Fincham. It left the 27-year old sprawling and the baby with (presumably) multiple serious injuries. Meanwhile, Josh proved to be the worst dad ever after pulling his baby's arm off. Fatherhood should definitely be put off a few years for this lot. 10. Dr Alex gets a grilling from Alexandra's mum After a rocky time together, Alexandra's mum showed her true sass when she came into the villa and called out Alex for his treatment of her daughter. ""He thought he could just drop you and pick you up at a whim, and that's not how life works,"" she fired. ""What did you expect a girl to feel like after she'd been rejected and then you deigned to bring her back to your side? I thought, 'hey young man, I'll have words with you!'""

The year-long £6m inquiry will probe reports of abuse in the island's children's homes and fostering services from 1960 to the present day. The health department had been given seven working days to comply, after originally refusing. Officials said they were concerned individual private details would be made public. A department spokesman said the records had been supplied on the understanding they would be managed in compliance with data protection laws. The records of those people who personally objected have also been sent to the inquiry. Its lawyers will write to those people explaining why they were needed and how they will be used.

"input: Quadruple amputee Corinne Hutton, from Lochwinnoch, went through a 12-hour procedure at Leeds General Infirmary. The news was announced by the charity Finding Your Feet, which the 47-year-old set up. The campaigner lost her hands and feet in 2013 after suffering acute pneumonia and sepsis, which nearly killed her. Speaking from her hospital bed after the operation, Ms Hutton thanked her medical team and said: ""I've got hands, they look exactly like mine. They look amazing. ""I've got fingers, and they can move - I shouldn't be doing that right enough, but it's absolutely incredible. I'm so thrilled."" A message on the Finding Your Feet Facebook page added: ""All of this happened on the anniversary of this beautiful community she created out of tragedy. You could call it fate."" Experts had been working to find suitable hands that were a match for the former businesswoman, who has campaigned to help raise awareness of organ and limb donation. After more than a dozen false alarms over the years, she was informed this week that a match for her own blood group, skin tone and hand size had been found. Finding Your Feet said she was taken by ambulance from her home to the hospital in West Yorkshire, where the surgery began at about 13: 00 on Monday. The team working on the procedure included Prof Andrew Hart, who performed the surgery to remove her hands and lower legs in 2013 and has since become a close friend. Prof Simon Kay, who led the team, performed the first double hand transplant in the UK in 2016, and Ms Hutton was his sixth procedure. He said: ""Corinne is one of the most positive, resilient and determined people I have met and despite all the hurdles she has faced she has now got the hands she wishes for. ""She didn't go into this lightly, she researched it deeply and understood the risks as well as the benefits. ""She realises what a remarkable life-affirming gift she has received from an unknown family devastated by grief and I know she will be forever grateful."" Supporting amputees Before she fell ill and was given a 5% chance of survival, Ms Hutton ran her own graphics company in Glasgow. She now devotes her life to the charity she founded to support amputees throughout the UK. Ms Hutton became the first female quadruple amputee to reach the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro, climbed Ben Nevis, abseiled, cycled around the Isle of Arran, took up skiing and ballroom dancing lessons. Her charity has so far raised more than £700,000 through fundraising and donations. In 2016 she also posed nude, with her body painted with organs and tissue that are deemed transplantable in a bid to help raise awareness of transplant issues. The first woman to receive a double hand transplant in the UK was Tanya Jackson, who was motivated to go for the procedure after seeing Ms Hutton on television. Inspire people A spokesman for Finding Your Feet thanked those who have supported Ms Hutton throughout her journey. He said: ""Cor was close to losing hope about finding a match for a transplant, but that's not her style. ""She has accomplished an unbelievable amount since losing her limbs, and we're certain she'll continue to inspire people as she builds up strength and learns to use her new hands. ""It's bittersweet, because transplants require a donor. That person and her family have changed the lives of many today, and made it possible for a mum to hold her son's hand again. Cor will not waste a moment with what they've given her.""

"input: By Matt LloydBBC News Steph Jeavons, 44, from Gwynedd, is to lead the first all-female motorcyclist group to Everest base camp. The 24-strong group, raising money for charities and good causes, will ride to an altitude of 17,000ft (5,200m) Along the 1,500-mile (2,400km) route, they will tackle narrow dirt roads, stomach-turning drops, extreme weather and altitude sickness. Steph, who is from Llanberis at the foot of Wales' highest peak Snowdon, is no stranger to taking on mammoth challenges. Last year she became the first Briton to circumnavigate the globe on a motorbike and ride on all seven continents, including Antarctica. Having travelled solo around the world, now she is leading a group of female riders from the UK, Germany, USA and Australia to the world's highest mountain. ""It's going to be a massive effort for everyone. Most of the women have never ridden outside of their own country let alone anywhere like this,"" she said. ""The biggest challenge will be their confidence. Often women don't do these extreme adventures because they lack the confidence rather than any ability. They're worried they will hold people back. ""I'm sure there will drama along the way, bumps, tears and people questioning why on earth they signed up. ""But the fact that there are no men means these women are going to have to do plenty for themselves and I know what they will get out of at the end. That's my motivation."" Among the international group are Sam Vernon and Amanda Hynan from Lincolnshire, Amy Harris from Bristol, Paula Hockey of Colchester, Essex and Janet Peter from Congleton, Cheshire. Julie Charlton, of West Woodburn, Northumberland, Emma Haynes from Winchester, Hampshire, and Dani Fiddaman, of Wantage, Oxfordshire, are also riding. It has taken two years of planning since The Friendship Highway through the Himalayas was reopened after it was damaged in the devastating April 2015 earthquake that killed almost 9,000 people. Starting on Sunday in Kathmandu, Nepal, they will ride for two weeks on Royal Enfield bikes through Nepal, into China and up through the towering peaks of Tibet to base camp. As well as mountain passes and glaciers, Steph admits the mental challenge will be as tough as the physical. ""There are some very high mountain passes on narrow paths with pretty big drops,"" she said. ""The roads themselves shouldn't be too bad but the sight of the drops is a psychological battle. ""Anything can happen at those heights, such as landslides or snow, and parts of the route could break up. However I'm probably just as worried about negotiating the traffic coming out of Kathmandu!""

"input: By Matthew MurrayBBC News Polling stations and count centres have had to be made safe and registering voters has become more complex by the inclusion of 16 and 17-year-olds. Traditional polling stations, like village halls, have often been closed during lockdown. And some councils have had to cope with count halls being turned into vaccination centres or field hospitals. Many older buildings have also been unsuitable because of poor ventilation. Some authorities will also host four separate counts: constituency and regional counts for the Senedd; Police and Crime Commissioner; and by-elections. But social distancing rules mean there will be fewer staff doing the counting on Friday, despite a greater number of votes to count. SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS: Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Flintshire council is one of those facing a juggling act. It is dealing with two Senedd constituencies with seven candidates in each. There are also 14 parties on its Senedd regional North Wales lists, five Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) candidates with a second preference voting system included, and several local by-elections. Flintshire chief executive Colin Everett is at the eye of the storm. He is the returning officer for the Flintshire constituencies; regional returning officer for the Senedd elections for North Wales; and police area returning officer for the PCC elections. ""After 40 years this will be my last set of elections,"" Mr Everett said. ""But I never would have foreseen we'd have such a strange circumstance with so many elections coming together at the tail end of a pandemic, but the job is there to be done and we'll do it well."" The elections were ""a massive logistical challenge"", he said. ""Only three months ago we were questioning whether it would be safe to hold these elections at all with the presence of Covid, and we've had to whittle down the risks one by one."" Mr Everett, who said he believed they were now safe to hold, will be dealing with about 350 elections staff. ""Our count centre is a huge double sports hall, which is a massive 'L' shape,"" he said. ""A sports hall running one way and indoor running track on the other side."" Flintshire has two constituency votes, so one will be counted in one hall and one in the other. ""It's a huge vacuous space so we are lucky because some councils have smaller centres and because of social distancing it's harder to pull it off,"" Mr Everett said. ""It's sometimes like a rugby scrum around a table where people are trying see what's going on. ""It'll be fewer staff with everyone spaced out, so it won't have the same atmosphere as previous years, but the important thing is we run this safely and we get a good safe election result which everyone trusts."" Flintshire council has an electorate of more than 120,000 people. A total of 21,000 postal votes have been sent out and more than 2,000 new young voters have registered. Mr Everett said: ""I am so pleased that Wales has followed Scotland's lead and enabled young people to vote. ""I think it's fantastic. It has been hard work getting young people to register, maybe because it's something new and the significance wasn't clear, but in the past few weeks we've seen many young people register. ""I think because people must register and vote either via post or turning up to a polling station, it's pretty alien for young people who are so used to the digital world."" In Ceredigion, council buildings were handed to the health board for use during the pandemic. This year's count will be held at Ysgol Bro Teifi in Llandysul for the first time. Lowri Edwards, head of democratic services at Ceredigion council, said: ""We've over come every challenge so far, but it's just taken longer than it'd normally take. ""I won't breathe though until Monday, and it's all done."" The count is being held at Ysgol Bro Teifi because it's bigger than the location in previous years at Aberaeron's leisure centre. ""The gym will be doing the count and it also gives us the main school hall,"" Ms Edwards said. ""The candidate and agents will be in the hall, so they won't be in the count room because of limited numbers. ""But we will stream what is happening in the count centre into the main hall."" Safety and accuracy were ""paramount,"" she said. ""It will take as long as it'll take."" The county has 77 polling stations with 235 staff working at them. An extra staff member has been employed at each station to manage voter flow. Ms Edwards said: ""Once you get into the polling stations, there'll be Perspex screens, protecting the electors and the staff. ""The staff will be two metres from each other unless they're in their own bubble. ""We do have some who are mother and daughter or husband and wife, so they can cwtch up a bit more. ""They'll all be wearing masks and we have hand sanitiser at every point through your journey through the polling station."" It was the result of ""a lot of hard work"", she added Natalie Chambers, 32, and her mother Dilys Davies, from Llanon, Ceredigion, will be working together at a polling station in Penparc, Cardigan. Council accountant Natalie said: ""After such a long time working from home in isolation it will be lovely to actually work face-to-face with someone, and the fact that it is family makes it even better."" Counting would normally get under way when polls close at 22:00 BST. This year it starts on Friday morning. Counting for Wales' Police and Crime Commissioner elections will be on Sunday. Head of Wales' Electoral Commission, Rhydian Thomas, said this year's elections were ""especially challenging"". He said: ""The commission has worked closely with a number of partners including the Wales Electoral Coordination Board, the Welsh and UK governments, the Senedd and political parties across Wales, to ensure the elections are delivered safely and effectively and that voters and campaigners are able to participate with confidence.

The event follows the Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibit, Manus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology.pieces. All the guests entered the event via a rose arch and some of the dinner place crockery had gold trim on them. It also provided the gala's theme of the convergence of man and machine. The exhibition will feature more than 100 both handmade haute couture and machine-made ready-to wear items. The Met Gala has been going since 1948. Each year, co-chairs and honorary event chairs are selected. Taylor Swift, Idris Elba, and Anna Wintour are this year's. Most celebs walk the carpet with their designers. Vogue's editor-in-chief Anna Wintour is the mastermind behind the whole event, and rumour has it that all outfits have to have her approval and that she even bans guests she doesn't know from buying tickets. It's not a cheap affair. Attendees shell out $25,000 (£17,000) for an individual ticket or commit to a minimum $175,000 (£119,000) for a table of 10. The event celebrates the opening of The Costume Institute's spring exhibition. The Costume Institute contains more than 35,000 pieces of clothing and accessories made in five continents over seven centuries. Past themes have covered everything from dance to punk to royal families. Last year's theme was China: Through The Looking Glass. Lady Gaga performed with Mark Ronson at the after party. According to The New York Times, the Gala has raised more than $145m (£99m) for The Costume Institute since 1995. The red carpet is 150 yards. Forget the front of dresses, check out the back of FKA Twigs. Of course, there were a number of memes, including a comparison of Lupita N'Yongo's look to Marge from the Simpsons. Emma Watson's outfit was made from recycled plastic bottles. Apparently Tamagotchis are still a thing... according to Orlando Bloom and Katy Perry who wore matchy, matchy ones as their ode to technology. This is what Clare Danes' 30 battery pack powered dress did and why she was still trending on Twitter for hours afterwards... Afterwards Lords posted an Instagram picture showing her cast signed by people at the Met Gala. The cast shows lots of signatures. Willow Smith and Jaden Smith Ciara had to stand up in the car en route to the gala so as not to break the crystals on her dress. It wasn't just the women's outfits that got attention.

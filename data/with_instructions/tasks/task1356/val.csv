input: Judges held that the Department of Justice (DoJ) had wrongly determined he would now be eligible to seek parole. In December, the sister of one of his victims won permission to challenge his eligibility to do so. Deborah McGuinness was granted leave to apply for a judicial review of the DoJ's calculations of his time served. Her brother, Thomas McErlean, was among three people killed by Stone in a gun and grenade attack at Milltown Cemetery in Belfast. The judges' verdict, on Tuesday, came as his case was set to go before the parole commissioners. That hearing has now been put on hold pending any appeal against the ruling. Stone, 63, was freed under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement in 2000, but was returned to jail six years later for trying to kill Sinn Féin leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness at Stormont in 2006. Mr Justice McCloskey, sitting with Mr Justice Colton, said a six year period spent out on licence before the murder attempt should not count towards his 30 year minimum term of imprisonment. He forfeited the benefits of that exceptional release by opting to commit further serious terrorist offences, the judges pointed out. Quashing the DoJ's decision, Mr Justice McCloskey confirmed: ""The earliest date upon which Mr Stone might be released on parole licence will fall around July 2024."" Ms McGuinness said she was relieved with the outcome. ""I just took this case to ensure Michael Stone served his sentence in full,"" she said. ""He was given 30 years in custody and I wanted certainty that he will do that,"" she added. Mr McErlean died in an attack on an IRA funeral in Milltown Cemetery in 1988. 'Forfeit' The ex-Ulster Defence Association (UDA) member was also the gunman in another three separate killings: Mr Justice McCloskey said: ""The Belfast Agreement afforded to convicted terrorists such as Mr Stone the opportunity to demonstrate that they were worthy of the exceptional benefit of significantly accelerated release from sentenced custody. ""Those, such as Mr Stone, who have elected not to do so forfeit this benefit and revert to their pre-release status."" ""The calculation of Mr Stone's earliest release date must make no allowance for the period of approximately six years which elapsed between the date of his exceptional early release from prison and the date of his subsequent further detention.""

Robert Sansom, of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said: ""The gap when it first opened up was a couple of inches but is now up to 3ft wide. ""Just because it has fallen away, it doesn't mean it's stable. It could continue slipping.

input: Thubelihle Dlodlo is nervous about leaving home in Emcitsheni village in rural KwaZulu-Natal. The 18-year-old has won a prized scholarship, but there is a catch: she only qualifies for the funding if she keeps her virginity. ""Remaining a virgin is my only chance to get an education because my parents can't afford to take me to school,"" she says. To continue receiving her funding, Ms Dlodlo has to undergo regular virginity tests but she says she does not mind. ""Virginity testing is part of my culture, it is not an invasion of my privacy and I feel proud after I'm confirmed to be pure."" The age of consent in South Africa is 16 years, though there is an exception which makes it legal for those older than 12 and younger than 16 to have sex with each other. Even with a strict interpretation of the law, Ms Dlodlo is already more than two years over the age of consent, but is only just starting her university career. But activists argue these tests are intrusive and that it is not fair to link opportunity to education and sex in this way: ""What is really worrying is that they are only focusing on the girl child and this is discriminatory and will not address problems with teenage pregnancy and HIV infection rates,"" says Palesa Mpapa from campaign group People Opposing Women Abuse. ""It's not only the girl that is to blame,"" she says. uThukela municipality mayor Dudu Mazibuko, who introduced this special category dedicated to virgin girls, disagrees. ""The scholarship is not a reward but a lifelong investment in the life of a girl, we are also not condemning those who've made different choices because we accommodate them in other scholarships,"" she said. The council offers more than 100 scholarships, 16 of which have been given to virgin female students. Culture and tradition In this part of the country, virginity testing is common practice. In Zulu culture, virginity testing is done by elderly women. It qualifies Zulu maidens to participate in the annual reed dance which takes place every September at Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini's royal palace. This practice is not against the law in South Africa but it has to be done with consent. Community leader Dudu Zwane has made it her mission to encourage young girls to abstain from sex. Affectionately known as ""Mum Dudu"", the 58-year-old gives talks at schools. ""It's very important for these girls to focus on their studies and stay away from boys,"" she says. The retired nurse also conducts virginity tests on young women. She agrees that her methods are not scientific but says she looks out for certain signs to prove that the girl has not had sex. ""The social standing of young women who remain virgins increases and many girls take pride in their results after being tested,"" she said. Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini recently questioned the merits of virginity testing. The practice ""complements other harmful practices such as female genital mutilation"", she said in a statement which upset traditionalists. In rural parts of KwaZula-Natal, virginity is celebrated and remaining ""pure"" is a source of pride for families. Ms Dlodlo says her friends are also virgins and envy her for being awarded the scholarship. She says she does not have a boyfriend, as she doesn't want to find herself in a position where she is pressured to have sex. ""I want to be a role model"", she says. Teenage pregnancy in South Africa Source: Human Sciences Research Council, World Bank; Stats SA 2013 Investigation Virginity testing is seen by some as the answer to stop the increasing numbers of teenage pregnancy and HIV and Aids. Teenage pregnancy is on the rise in South Africa. In 2013, a survey released by Stats SA as part of its General Household found that teen pregnancies had risen to nearly 100,000, up from 68,000 just two years earlier. The South African Council for Educators and the education department labelled the figures an unprecedented crisis. This is despite the fact that the country's schools offer sex education and that free maternal care is also available nationwide. South Africa already has the highest number of people living with HIV in the world, but what is even more alarming is that the highest new HIV infections are amongst young women aged 15-24. Following the outcry, the South African Human Rights Commission has said it will investigate whether the scholarships are against the constitution.

input: By Geeta PandeyBBC News, Delhi The actor has often been found on the wrong side of law - besides being found guilty of killing protected animals, he was accused in 2002 of running over five homeless men in Mumbai, killing one of them. He's also been accused of assaulting former girlfriends and generally being misogynistic. But Khan is also one of India's biggest and most popular film stars. The 52-year-old actor has starred in nearly 100 Hindi-language films, is known for his romantic roles as well as action films, and has won several prestigious Indian cinema awards. He is that rare Bollywood star who has a huge fan following across the vast spectrum of Indian society - his fans include the middle-class English-speaking audiences as well as poor slum dwellers for whom the 350-rupee ($5.20; £3.40) tickets do not come cheap. His films are released to coincide with major festivals like Eid or Christmas, and are screened in thousands of theatres which are generally packed for days. Every time Khan romances his heroines on screen, his fans respond with approval. Loud whistles fill the theatre when he shows his dance moves, and resounding claps encourage him whenever he beats up the ""baddies"". Courting controversy But his fame has brought with it a long-held image of a larger-than-life macho superstar who lives dangerously. Despite the controversies and accusations of bad behaviour, Khan's fan base has remained loyal - in fact, it has kept growing steadily and the hits have kept coming. Several of his latest films - Tiger Zinda Hai, Sultan, Prem Ratan Dhan Payo, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Dabangg and Dabangg2 - have been huge blockbusters. Khan has hosted most of the 11 seasons of Bigg Boss, the Indian version of the Dutch reality TV show Big Brother and it remains popular because of him. And he is a hit on social media too - his Facebook page is liked by 36 million fans while on Twitter he has 32.5 million followers. But there is another side to Khan, the eldest of the three sons of well-known screenplay writer Salim Khan. Stories about his brawls at parties have long filled the Bollywood gossip columns, and his link-ups with some of his leading ladies have also proved controversial. In one notorious incident, an angry Khan was reported to have emptied a bottle of cola over the head of an ex-girlfriend in a restaurant. Another relationship, with actress and former Miss World Aishwarya Rai, ended acrimoniously with Ms Rai later making allegations that she was beaten up by Khan - a charge he has denied. In the past few years, the actor has worked hard to shed his ""bad boy"" image - with some success. His devotion to his family, particularly his brothers, is well known and he is reputed to go out of his way to help friends and even strangers. A few years ago, he started Being Human, a charity to help the underprivileged through education and healthcare. The charity sells T-shirts and other products online and in stores, and the proceeds are used for charitable work. His relationships with women also seem to have matured. Although he parted ways with actress Katrina Kaif some time ago, they remain good friends and the couple acted together in in Tiger Zinda Hai and Ek Tha Tiger. But two years ago, he caused outrage by saying that his filming schedule for Sultan was so gruelling that he felt like a ""raped woman"". He also said he was able to quit every ""vice"" - like cigarettes, alcohol and coffee - except women. An outraged National Commission for Women (NCW) ordered him to apologise and even summoned him to appear before them. Khan's father said sorry on his behalf and his actor brother called his comments ""not appropriate"", but he himself refused to apologise. Through his lawyer, Khan told the commission that they did not have the ""jurisdiction to take matter of this kind"", and the actor managed to thumb his nose at them and get away. So far, he's also managed to evade punishment in serious criminal cases against him. Brush with law In the 2002 hit-and-run incident in Mumbai, the trial court convicted him in May 2015 and handed him a prison sentence of five years. Even though the guilty verdict came after 13 years, many said the misdeeds of his past might have finally caught up with him. But the actor got a massive boost in December of the same year when the high court overturned his conviction. Last year, the prosecution appealed in the Supreme Court and the case is under consideration there. The illegal hunting and killing of the protected gazelles and blackbucks in 1998 in the western state of Rajasthan was his first serious brush with the law. On Thursday, the trial court judge called him a ""habitual offender"" while handing him a five-year sentence, but it's unlikely that he will spend more than a few days in jail. His lawyers have said they will appeal against the order in the high court and they have already filed a bail plea. In two of the four cases that were originally filed against him for killing the rare animals, he was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison in 2006, but spent less than a week inside before being released on bail. And in July 2016, in a major setback for the prosecution, the Rajasthan high court overturned his conviction. An appeal against that order is pending in the Supreme Court, but there's no clarity when an order will come. So Thursday's court verdict may just be another minor setback for him.

Now complete the following example-
input: The grant that funds the network had been cut by about 22%, Andy Burnham told MPs in an opposition day debate. He said councils around the UK were closing centres or cutting services. Education Secretary Michael Gove said many councils were maintaining services and enough money was available. Some of the 3,600 Sure Start children's centres are being cut because the grant that funds them was cut by 11% in last year's emergency budget, and again in the comprehensive spending review by almost the same percentage. Then the government removed the protection from the Sure Start budget. This has left them vulnerable, as councils seek to make up losses to their central government grants overall. 'Smoke and mirrors' Mr Burnham was proposing a motion urging the government to reconsider removing the ring-fencing. He listed examples of cuts from around the country, such as Derby, where he said six centres were threatened with closure, Barnet where he said eight of 21 centres were losing their funding, Bromley, which he said was closing 13 of its 16 centres, and Hull, where he said a 50% cut to children's centre funding meant 13 out of 20 would be ""effectively mothballed"". Mr Burnham also spoke about ""smoke and mirrors"" in cases such as Hammersmith and Fulham, where centres were not being closed but services in some were being cut in a model of ""hub"" and ""spoke"" centres. Some of these ""spoke"" centres had just a £25,000 annual budget, he said. ""Children's centres are closing - right here, right now, highly skilled staff are being made redundant, some centres are keeping the lights on, but nothing more than that,"" said Mr Burnham. ""Sure Start is being starved, it's shrinking. Coalition policy is turning a much-loved, universal service into a patchy, postcode lottery, breaking the prime minister's promises to parents,"" he said. 'Slur' However, several MPs spoke out to say centres were not being cut in their areas, including West Sussex, Tameside, Ipswich and also Medway, where funding was being increased. The shadow education secretary also told MPs Hampshire council intended to close 28 of its 81 children's centres. But the council had announced on Wednesday that all centres would remain open and cuts of £6m to its £17m budget would apply to back-office expenditure only, leading Mr Gove to accuse Mr Burnham of a ""slur"" against Hampshire. He said Labour was peddling ""gloomy predications"" that later turned out not to be true. Ministers have said that enough money remains in the system to keep Sure Start centres open, even as the coalition works to reduce the national deficit, but that they also want to see services better targeted to meet the needs of the poorest parents. ""Independent witnesses say the money is there. Well-run local authorities all over the country represented by councillors of different parties are maintaining that network,"" said Mr Gove. ""In just a few days' time when people think about how to cast their vote I hope that people will reflect on which parties are acting responsibly in dealing with the national crisis and which parties prefer posturing, irresponsibility and the emptiness of eternal opposition,"" he said. 'Universal services' Labour MP Frank Field, who was commissioned by the coalition to carry out a review of social mobility and early years education, said he believed the government was unlikely to reverse last year's decision to remove the funding ring-fence. But he said he hoped that the coalition would, in future, preserve dedicated funding for early years provision. However, he also questioned whether there was enough information available to assess whether Sure Start funding was being ""spent in the best way possible"". Shadow education minister Sharon Hodgson said it was ""simply not true"" there was sufficient funding to maintain services. ""There isn't enough money, not if ministers expect councils to deliver all the other important programmes that grant pays for, such as breaks for disabled children,"" she said. Children's Minister Tim Loughton said the government was ""100% committed"" to Sure Start. The aim was ""universal services, accessible to all, with targeted support for the families in greatest need"" he said. But this should be achieved by trusting local authorities to make decisions, giving centres more flexibility and involving a greater diversity of providers, he said. The motion was defeated by 312 votes to 217.

The sites' owners said they were bombarded with data in an attempt to overwhelm their computers and knock them offline. Some of the organisations involved have blamed the assault on state-sponsored ""criminals"". Over the weekend Russians voted in elections that determined the make-up of its lower house, or Duma, for the next five years. In the run-up to voting and on the day itself, many organisations critical of the policies of the ruling party said they had suffered attack by hackers. One of the hardest hit seems to have been the election monitoring group Golos, which said it had come under a ""massive DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks"". A distributed denial of service attack is one in which a website is hit with many thousands of requests for data. Unless the flood of requests is halted, sites can be knocked offline. On voting day, Golos was compiling a map of ""election violations"" which detailed places where irregularities in votes were being recorded. Despite the attacks, Golos said it had been able to log about 5,300 complaints alleging election violations. Golos head Liliya Shibanova said mounting the attacks would have been a ""very expensive operation"". She said: ""It's a big organisation with plenty of means that must have done it."" 'Violations' The Moscow Echo radio station, opposition newspaper New Times, political commentary site Slon.ru and daily business paper Kommersant also suffered the attentions of politically motivated hackers. Moscow Echo editor-in-chief Alexei Venediktov tweeted: ""The attack on the website on election day is clearly an attempt to inhibit publication of information about violations."" The Russian arm of the Livejournal blogging site had also been intermittently available during the week before voting day as it came under repeated DDoS attacks. Anton Nossik, media director of LiveJournal owner SUP, alleged that the perpetrators were criminals, ""probably fattened by the federal budget"". Most of the attacks were directed at groups and media organisations that oppose the Putin government, but some Pro-Kremlin groups were also targeted. Youth activists said their site which logged election violations by opposition parties had also come under fire.

Metro owners Nexus said it was working to make sure it did not happen again. More than 55,000 people took part in the half marathon on 13 September. Early in the day six trains failed or were cancelled, on top of the already reduced service, leaving capacity down by between 25% and 44% across the network, the Nexus report said. Squeezing large numbers of passengers onto fewer overcrowded trains and treating those who subsequently felt unwell also caused delays, it added. 'No excuses' Disruption also meant trains bunched together, tripping overhead power lines. The report into what happened concluded DBTW addressed driver shortages by reducing the timetable and did not inform Nexus or its own directors. Nexus staff failed to notice the number of trains planned did not meet its requirements. Additional driver shortages on the day made the situation worse. DBTW managing director Sharon Kelly said she made ""no excuses for what happened"". ""Mistakes were made in terms of planning for this event, which have been subject to a review that has now concluded, and we have immediately taken actions to ensure this never happens again,"" she said. Complaints by customers relating to the race rose from 5 in 2014, to 517. Nexus managing director Tobyn Hughes apologised and said the company was ""working closely"" with DBTW to ""prevent a repeat of the problems"". The report's recommendations include DBTW reviewing plans for future marathons, addressing driver shortages and improving communication of problems.

input: Bedfordshire Assistant Chief Constable Jackie Sebire said some young people who do not have the ""protective factor"" of a father figure instead look up to drug dealers and gangsters. She said it was ""too easy"" to blame police cuts, social media and drugs. The government said early intervention projects were a focus of its efforts. ACC Sebire, who leads on serious violence for the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), said an absence of father figures affects children in affluent areas as well as those from disadvantaged backgrounds. ""We don't talk enough"" about the issue, she added. A report published last year estimated that about 27,000 children in England considered themselves to be in a gang. However, a much lower figure of 6,560 children were actually known by youth offending teams or children's services to be involved in gangs. Sheldon Thomas, founder of Gangsline, which provides support to young people involved or at risk of gang activity, said ""bad parenting, absent fathers and bad male role models"" are among the biggest problems when tackling gang violence. Mr Thomas, who speaks of his own experience as a gang member in the 1970s, said that if parents do not spend time with their children, then their child ""is more likely to end up down the wrong road"". ACC Sebire said: ""Where you do have positive male role models, they are potentially the drug dealers, or the exploiters or the organised criminal networks - they become the positive male role model."" The ""worst thing"", she said, was when both parents refused to attend a police station after their children had been arrested. ""That's for me, one of the saddest things that I see... because actually they [the parents] can't be bothered."" But speaking to reporters at the NPCC conference in Westminster this week, ACC Sebire acknowledged a number of factors contributed to the problem of knife crime. In 2018 the Home Office said drugs, and in particular a surge in the supply of cocaine, was the main ""driver"" behind the rise in serious violence. Other possible factors were said to be the growth of social media and an increase in school exclusions and children in care. But there were only two passing references to ""role models"" in the department's 114-page strategy document and no mention of how the absence of such father figures might lead young people down the path towards drug dealing and violent crime. Discussions about ways to reduce violent crime have also tended to focus on other issues, such as resources, stop-and-search powers and sentencing. It has been left largely to youth workers, mentors and former gang members to highlight the importance of positive role models, which is why the comments of Jackie Sebire, a former Scotland Yard detective with over 25 years' experience in policing, are so significant. Patrick Green, chief executive officer of anti-knife charity the Ben Kinsella Trust, said ACC Sebire was ""absolutely right"" to cite the role of positive male models. ""When this is absent, young boys tend to be more vulnerable to negative influences."" However, he added there is ""no single answer"" and stressed the need for other root causes such as poverty, deprivation and inequality to be tackled. A government spokesperson highlighted plans to recruit extra police officers over the next three years and initiatives to tackle the root causes of serious violence. They added: ""We recognise the role trusted role models have to play and to steer young people away from crime and to stop young people being exploited by gangs, we are investing heavily in community-based early intervention projects.""

input: But Eluned Morgan conceded that it would be ""difficult for us to stop"" from a legal point of view. Her comments were criticised by a Labour AM. Alun Davies said threatening legal action ""sounds like the last breath before you're thrown out of the pub"". Mr Davies said he was not convinced the Welsh Government would ""have a leg to stand on"" in trying to shape international trade deals after Brexit. Following Donald Trump's comments during last week's trade visit that the NHS would be ""on the table"" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was ""absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation."" The US President then rowed back on his initial comments following criticism from a number of MPs. Asked about her response to President Trump's remarks as she gave evidence to the Assembly's Brexit committee on Monday, Ms Morgan said ""legally, it would be difficult for us to stop because we don't have a veto over trade"".

input: The device will be marketed in partnership with the local internet retail giant JD.com. The team behind the Nokia 6 phone said the handset's ""premium design"" would appeal to the local market. The announcement coincided with the final day of the CES tech show in Las Vegas, where other new mobile phones and gadgets have been launched. Nokia no longer manufactures phones that carry its name but has instead licensed its brand to another Finnish company, HMD Global. Until now, the only phones that had been released under the deal had been more basic ""feature phone"" models. The Android device had been highly anticipated and marks Nokia's return to the smartphone market after a series of Windows Phone models. Nokia also briefly sold Android-based handsets - known as Nokia X - in 2014. Microsoft used Nokia's brand for a short time after buying the company's mobile devices the same year, but later referred to the devices solely by their Lumia name. Mobile World Congress Nokia once dominated the mobile phone market but struggled after the launch of the iPhone a decade ago, and the subsequent release of Google's Android operating system. HMD Global had previously indicated it would release several Nokia-branded Android phones in 2017. It is expected to provide details of at least some of the other launches at another trade show - Barcelona's Mobile World Congress - in February. ""The decision by HMD to launch its first Android smartphone into China is a reflection of the desire to meet the real world needs of consumers in different markets around the world,"" the firm said in a statement. ""With over 552 million smartphone users in China in 2016, a figure that is predicted to grow to more than 593 million users by 2017, it is a strategically important market where premium design and quality is highly valued by consumers."" The Nokia 6 phone runs Android 7.0 - the latest version, also known as Nougat - and features: The specifications are mid-range, and so is the price: 1,699 yuan ($245; £200). That makes it slightly more expensive than Huawei's Honor 6X but cheaper than Xiaomi's Mi 5s. ""Nokia remains one of the most recognised mobile phone brands on the planet,"" commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight technology consultancy. ""HMD Global will be hoping it can capitalise on this as it seeks to relaunch Nokia devices in 2017. ""It will be hoping the brand will help it stand out in the incredibly crowded Android smartphone market, which is characterised by cut-throat competition and a sea of design sameness. "" Brandon Ackroyd, Head of Customer Insight at Tiger Mobiles believes that Nokia will launch the Nokia 6 globally if the device has a successful launch in Asia. ""If the Nokia 6 performs well in China then it's highly likely we will see a new international variant of the handset sometime in 2017. We'll be keeping our eyes on the certification websites in the coming months looking for a variant with more connectivity options like GSM, LTE, and CDMA that will make the device compatible with networks worldwide.""

input: President Donald Trump said Mr Mnuchin had spent his career making money in the private sector and would now work for the taxpayer. Mr Mnuchin pledged to create jobs and combat terrorist financing. Democrats had argued that Mr Mnuchin had made a fortune foreclosing on families during the financial crisis. The top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, Maxine Waters of California, called Mr Mnuchin ""the foreclosure king"". His critics have also questioned whether he is too close to the Wall Street banking community, which he will be responsible for regulating. Democrats also complained that Mr Mnuchin had failed to disclose nearly $100m (£79m) in assets when he filed with the Senate Finance Committee. Mr Mnuchin spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before becoming a hedge fund manager. He later founded a film production company that was behind such box office hits as the X-Men franchise and American Sniper. Mr Trump said Mr Mnuchin would help make the US a ""jobs magnet"". ""He'll work 24 hours a day, I know him. He'll work 28 hours a day if they give him the extra four hours,"" he said. Another former Goldman executive, Gary Cohn, is the director of President Trump's National Economic Council. What do we know about the new treasury secretary's policy plans? Mr Mnuchin hasn't announced a fully fledged plan, but his responses in media interviews and during the Senate debate over his appointment make clear some of his priorities: There are still many policy areas that have not been addressed, including how he will approach trading relations with China, Mexico and other partners.

The government appointed a retired judge, Mahanama Thilakaratne, in September to investigate the abductions, but so far no report has been submitted. Last month, the Asian Human Rights Commission accused the government of abducting suspected rebels. The government has denied any involvement. The Sri Lankan Human Rights Commission said at least four hundred Tamil youths have gone missing from the northern Jaffna peninsula since December. The Tamil Tigers have also been accused of abducting civilians by human rights groups.

input: The competition will be held at the Perthshire resort in 2014, the first time it has been held on Scottish soil almost 40 years. Aberdonian golfer Paul Lawrie handed the trophy over to Gleneagles Chief Executive Patrick Elsmie to mark the countdown to the event. Scotland's economy is expected benefit by £100m by hosting the Ryder Cup. Lawrie, who played a key role in helping the European team to retain the Ryder Cup at Medinah at the weekend, made the stop at Gleneagles before making his way to St Andrew's for the Dunhill Links Championship which begins on Thursday. Spurring event He said was delighted to see the cup return to Scotland: ""This is the home of golf and it somehow feels right to be taking the trophy, and all it represents, to Gleneagles. ""I have never experienced anything like that final day in Medinah, but being involved has spurred me on to hopefully play a part in Team Europe at Gleneagles 2014. ""It will be a really special event and I hope I can do enough to be in contention."" Patrick Elsmie, managing director of Gleneagles, said it was an honour to host the Ryder Cup: ""The Medinah Country Club set an incredibly high bar in hosting a truly memorable Ryder Cup, but the scenes in Chicago also demonstrated just why we were so keen to host this amazing sporting event. ""Seeing the trophy here at Gleneagles today brings home the fact that it's Scotland's turn next, and that the countdown to the 2014 Matches has begun. ""It is going to be a wonderful time for Scotland, and we at Gleneagles will ensure the tradition, class and theatre of The Ryder Cup are celebrated in style."" Economic boost The event is expected to be one of the largest ever hosted in the country with the Scottish government spending about £20m to stage the match. It is anticipated that over the week of the competition an additional £100 million will come into the Scottish economy. About 250,000 people are expected to travel to Perthshire to attend the event, with an estimated half a billion households watching it on television. Ryder Cup Director Richard Hills said: ""Medinah was epic and has given Scotland a real taste of what to expect in two years' time. Bringing the trophy back to the Home of Golf is the perfect way to continue Team Europe's celebrations."" First Minister Alex Salmond said the arrival of the cup meant that the countdown to the 2014 tournament had begun. Increased expectations Mr Salmond said: ""The Ryder Cup is going to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland. ""Before last weekend in Medinah it was estimated that 2014 would pump £100m into the local and wider Scottish economy during the tournament week alone. ""However, last weekend showed us that the Ryder Cup continues to grow in scale tournament-by-tournament. Scotland's Ryder Cup in 2014 is now likely to be even bigger than we have anticipated up to now.""

input: The proposals are designed to replace a current grass pitch on the Crichton Estate in Dumfries. The Architectural Heritage Society of Scotland has voiced concerns about the impact on the landscape. However, planning officers say that is outweighed by the potential economic and community benefits. The £410,000 scheme is a joint project between Dumfries and Galloway College, Dumfries and Galloway Council and the Crichton Development Company. It has received grant support from Sport Scotland. If the scheme receives planning permission a new pitch, fencing and floodlights would be built at Hospital Park, the home ground of South of Scotland League side Crichton FC.

input: Fox wants to buy the 61% of Sky it does not already own. But it faces regulatory problems after the Competition and Markets Authority found the £11.7bn deal was not in the public interest. Fox had already pledged to ensure the independence of Sky News. The Murdoch family's news outlets are currently consumed by nearly a third of the UK's population across TV, radio, online and newspapers. The Murdoch Family Trust controls News Corporation, which publishes newspapers including the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times. Sky was the top gainer on the FTSE 100 in early afternoon trading on Tuesday, with shares up about 2%. What is the ring-fencing proposal? Under the proposed new deal, the news channel would become a distinct company within Sky, run by the head of Sky News. Funding for Sky News would also be guaranteed for 15 years. Previously, Fox had said it would be funded for 10 years. The executive chairmen of Sky, Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, and the chief executive, Chase Carey, would not try to influence editorial decisions made by the head of Sky News, according to a statement by 21st Century Fox. The company had already proposed remedies to the CMA's concerns, including having an independent board for Sky News. However, critics of that proposal, including politicians such as Ed Miliband, Vince Cable and Kenneth Clarke, had said that the head of Sky News would still be appointed by the head of 21st Century Fox and so could be influenced by the Murdochs. Fox hit back at those politicians on Tuesday, saying their assertions were ""unsupported and fanciful"". What is the new Disney proposal? Fox also proposed selling off Sky News to Disney, whether or not Disney's proposed acquisition of Fox goes through. Disney's proposed takeover of 21st Century Fox, which has yet to be approved by regulators, includes Fox's current 39% stake in Sky. Even if that takeover gets knocked back, Sky News would still be sold off under the new proposal. Disney chief executive Bob Iger is keen on Sky and has said he is ""committed"" to Sky News, which is loss-making. US media giant Comcast has also thrown its hat into the ring for Sky with a £22.1bn bid in February. Comcast has a broadband division serving 29 million US customers. It also owns NBC and Universal Pictures and wants to buy a majority stake in Sky. What do Sky shareholders think of the proposals? Analysis: Simon Jack, business editor This is great news for Sky shareholders. If Sky News is sold to Disney or legally separated from the rest of Sky, then the thorny issue of Murdoch control over Sky News - to add to the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times - is finally laid to rest. What we will then have is a straight shoot out between 21st Century Fox and US rival Comcast to acquire Sky. A proper auction between those two bidders will mean a higher price for Sky. Currently Fox is offering £10.75 per share and Comcast has indicated it would be prepared to bid £12.50. Directors at Sky are pretty confident that Fox will have to come in with a better offer. At that point, we will see how serious Comcast really is in its bid to derail Rupert Murdoch's carefully laid plans to sell Fox to Disney and effectively dismantle a media empire it has taken a lifetime to build.

input: The victim, named locally as Ozell Pemberton, 16, was found injured at about 15:30 BST on Thursday at Lower Parade in the main shopping area of Sutton Coldfield, north of Birmingham. West Midlands Police said the suspect handed himself into a police station in the early hours and remains in custody. The attack reportedly took place near a McDonald's and a group of bus stops. Police said there had been disorder in the area at the time and several people were seen fleeing. The ambulance service said despite its ""tremendous efforts"", Ozell was confirmed dead at the scene. Police said he has has not yet been formally identified and a post-mortem examination will be held in due course. But a tribute to Ozell was released by his former school earlier. ""We were deeply saddened to hear about the tragic death of one of our former pupils and our thoughts and prayers are with his family,"" a spokesperson for Greenwood Academy, Castle Vale, said. ""For our part, we are providing counselling and support to our pupils and staff to help them through this difficult time."" Staff said he last attended the school in November 2015. Councillor David Pears, who represents the Sutton Trinity ward, described the violence as ""appalling"". He added: ""My sympathies go out to this person's family and their friends. ""I think people want to feel safe; it's really important that police take action very quickly."" Analysis by Sima Kotecha, BBC Midlands correspondent Unfortunately fatal stabbings in Birmingham are nothing new. This crime happened in the affluent area of Sutton Coldfield and in the middle of the afternoon. The age of the victim is also unnerving; just 16 and killed as a result of what officers call ""disorder"" involving several people. At a time when police resources are stretched in the region and crime rates are soaring, there is a palpable fear among some residents who are repeatedly saying that they just don't feel safe anymore. That fear is particularly prevalent among the older generation, but the victims in many of these violent cases are young men and boys. @sima_kotecha Part of Lower Parade remains sealed off for investigations to be carried out. West Midlands Police Assistant Chief Constable, Alex Murray, said: ""This is a tragic set of circumstances and our thoughts, and I'm sure the thoughts of everyone in the community, are with the boy's family at this truly devastating time. ""A dedicated team of homicide detectives has worked non-stop on the investigation since yesterday and has made good progress."" Mr Murray added: ""We need parents, community leaders, schools and young people themselves to pass the message that it is never OK to carry or use a knife."" David Jamieson, the West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner, said ""much more needs to be done"". ""This is another stark reminder of the importance and responsibility we all have in ending violence in our communities,"" he said. Mr Jamieson said he was spending an extra £2m ""tackling violence"" over the next two years. Knife crime in the West Midlands Source: West Midlands Police Related Internet Links West Midlands Police

input: Muller said ""an unprecedented 25% surge"" in farm milk production since 2014 meant supply was now ""substantially"" outstripping demand. A month-long review with its 230 Scottish suppliers concluded that the situation was ""unviable"". It will now give 14 dairy farms in Aberdeenshire 12 months' notice. Muller said the suppliers were based in areas which presented ""heightened or complex logistical transport challenges"" for the company. In a statement, the milk processor also announced plans to introduce a tiered transport charge for suppliers in Scotland from February. Muller had warned its suppliers that the growing milk surplus was not sustainable and had ""significant environmental consequences."" It said surplus milk was currently being transported to England, resulting in more than 6,000 tanker movements travelling a total of 2.5 million miles each year. Rob Hutchison, from Muller Milk and Ingredients, said: ""We fully appreciate that these measures will be extremely unwelcome and destabilising for our farmer suppliers particularly in the north east of Scotland, but the current situation is unviable and we must act. ""We completed the largest single investment in fresh milk processing in Scotland in more than a decade at our dairy in Bellshill last year and we will continue to do what we can to stimulate new demand for fresh milk. ""But with fresh milk already in 96% of the nation's fridges and overall consumer demand for the product in marginal decline, the reality is that it is extremely unlikely that this sector will soak up the heightened levels of milk production from farms which we have seen."" 'Devastating news' Commenting on the announcement, NFU Scotland president Andrew McCornick said it was ""clearly devastating news"". He added: ""Given the considerable commitment and investment made by dairy farmers, we now have producers looking to find a new buyer in the next year if they wish to continue milking cows while others, through haulage charges, face a significant cut in income at a time when milk prices are struggling to cover the cost of production."" Last month, Muller announced the closure of its Aberdeen depot with the loss of up to 45 jobs. Muller's distribution, garage, tanker and retail operations in the city had been the focus of a 30-day consultation process. The company said the decision was ""against a backdrop of declining consumption of fresh milk and significant changes in retailing"".

input: Half of those consulted by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said patient care was compromised by insufficient staffing on their most recent shift. The claims emerged in a submission to Holyrood's health committee on the 2018/19 draft budget. The Scottish government said the number of nurses and midwives had significantly increased since 2012. It is also committed to increasing the number of training places for health care workers, Health Secretary Shona Robison added. However the report is the latest in a series of warnings over staffing issues in Scotland's health service. The RCN's submission was based on the preliminary results of a survey of 3,300 nurses and health care support workers from across Scotland. Of those who said high quality care had been affected by staff shortages, a third said there were not enough registered nurses. A quarter said there were inadequate numbers of health care support workers and nearly half had concerns about the mix of skills on their last shift. Other findings include: The RCN used their report to call for more support for the healthcare workforce. It said: ""There needs to be recognition of the fact that people are the NHS' greatest resource and that investment in workforce will have a positive impact for patients, as well as seeing improvements in areas like sickness rates and retention."" And it added: ""The RCN recognises the Scottish government's commitment to scrapping the 1% pay cap for NHS staff, but unless staff are appropriately remunerated, as well as being given the time and support to develop, issues around recruitment and retention within nursing teams will persist."" The RCN will publish more detailed analysis of the survey results later in the summer. 'Damning insight' The findings have led to further claims that morale among health care staff is at ""rock bottom"" and nurses are being ""stretched to breaking point"". Scottish Labour health spokesman Anas Sarwar said: ""This is a deeply worrying revelation. ""It reinforces our warnings that the SNP has presided over a workforce crisis in our NHS, leaving staff over-worked, under-valued and under-resourced. ""Morale is at rock bottom in the health service, with staff reporting there simply aren't enough of them to do the job properly. That risks compromising patient safety. ""This is part of the legacy left by Nicola Sturgeon who as health secretary slashed the number of training places for nurses and midwives. ""As a result, spending on agency nurses in Scotland has risen six-fold in just five years under the SNP, which is just one reason why our health service is in desperate need for a meaningful workforce plan."" Serious concerns Alex Cole-Hamilton, the Scottish Liberal Democrat's health spokesman, described it as a ""damning insight"" into the state of Scotland's NHS. He added: ""Our nurses within the NHS work incredibly hard but it is clear they are being stretched to breaking point. ""The SNP need to step in immediately and make sure that our wards are fully staffed. ""That starts by scrapping the NHS pay cap and give staff the resources and support they need to do their jobs. "" The Scottish Conservative's Miles Briggs said hospitals were being hit by the SNP government's ""horrendous lack of forward planning"". ""This is more damning evidence of that mismanagement, and it comes from those who know best,"" he added. ""We have warned the Scottish government for years that there aren't enough nurses working currently, and there aren't enough coming through the system. ""This falls completely on the SNP's head, and it must act swiftly to address these very serious concerns."" 'Safe staffing' Shona Robison, the cabinet secretary for health, defended the government's record. She said: ""There are over 3,300 more whole time equivalent nursing and midwifery staff working in our NHS compared to five years ago. This year we have also increased nursing and midwifery training places by 4.7%, bringing the total number of places available in 2017-18 to 3,360. ""For the last five years, this government has made consecutive increases to the number of student nurse training places. ""We're working with health boards to reduce the overall use of agency staff, including by establishing regional and national staff banks - which allows health boards greater access to a pool of highly-skilled, flexible NHS staff.

input: Glendon Spence and his friends sought refuge at the Marcus Lipton Youth Centre in Brixton on 21 February when two men armed with knives ran at them. The Old Bailey heard the 23-year-old was fatally stabbed in the thigh when he tripped and fell. The defendants, aged 17 and 18, both deny murder. The 17-year-old, who is alleged to have stabbed Mr Spence and cannot be named because of his age, denies being at the scene. Chibuzo Ukonu, of Loughton, Essex, admitted being present and in possession of a knife but denies intending to harm anyone or causing any injuries to Mr Spence. Jurors were told the attack, which happened at about 18:45 GMT, was captured on CCTV. They heard the defendants had been dropped off by a BMW Series 5 car which had been bought by Mr Ukonu days before. Prosecutor Julian Evans said: ""Glendon ran into the main room and headed towards the far end. ""As he ran, he lost his footing and fell to the ground. He managed to get up but he fell over again near to the corner of the main room close to a table tennis table."" He said as Mr Spence lay on the floor, the 17-year-old stabbed him in his right thigh, which caused ""sudden and immediate blood loss"". 'Flight to Uganda' As the attackers ran back to the waiting car Mr Spence was able to get to his feet but collapsed again, the court heard. He died at the scene at about 19:30. Later that night, the BMW car was found fire-damaged and abandoned on the Peabody Estate in south London, jurors heard. Mr Ukonu took a coach to Manchester the next day while his co-accused was arrested as he attempted to take a flight to Uganda from Heathrow Airport, the court was told. The trial continues.

input: By Ross HawkinsPolitical correspondent, BBC News Remember the councillor who thought Hitler was the greatest man in history? Remember the candidate who suggested asking the so-called Islamic State why it wasn't attacking Israel? Remember the student who said a large part of the Oxford University Labour Club had a ""problem with Jews""? Imagine the reaction, Jewish figures say, if these were stories about any other minority. They appear with politically damaging regularity. Now, though, it seems change will come. Activists and MPs have told BBC Radio 4's Today programme they are trying to toughen the rules on anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and racism. Even if they fail, I'm told a party review by Labour peer Lady Royall into allegations of anti-Semitism may well also suggest rewriting the rulebook. Poisonous atmosphere That is highly unlikely to be the end of this story, though, because it goes to the heart of a poisonous atmosphere in parts of the Labour movement. Jeremy Corbyn's critics - who are many and vociferous - put the blame at his door. It is he, they say, who has attracted new members with these views, who has condemned anti-Semitism but not acted and who has - on occasion - made what they think are utterly inadequate responses to offensive language. Their concerns are fundamental - they simply don't believe anyone who describes the Palestinian militant group Hamas as a friend wants to tackle this issue. On the other side, his supporters remind us of those condemnations of anti-Semitism and the decision to launch an inquiry, and point out this is not a new problem. Lost in the fury about a member suspended then readmitted after anti-Semitic comments only to become vice-chair of her local party, was the fact those decisions were made not under Mr Corbyn, but his predecessor Ed Miliband. No Labour leader could be expected to vet the thousands of new members who have signed up. For some fighting Mr Corbyn's corner, this issue is serious and real, but is also being used as a stick to beat him by his internal political enemies. There are those who have long seen allegations of anti-Semitism as attempts to silence legitimate criticism of Israel - on which different wings of the Labour movement take passionately opposing views. The political debate, then, is not at heart merely a row about rules or party management, but fundamental differences within Labour. Changing the rulebook will not necessarily change what people say or write, merely how they are dealt with. It certainly won't change how people feel, and there are plenty in Labour who seek no part in its civil wars but wonder why anti-Semites choose to join their party.

The service was held at Maksymilian Kolbe Church, on Gordon Road - the church Mrs Kaczan was walking to at the time of the bag snatch. Arthur Waszkiewicz, from west London, has denied manslaughter and robbery. Mrs Kaczan, who was born in Poland, came to the UK after escaping a Nazi prison camp during World War Two. Although she has no remaining family, friends said her death had left a big impression on those who knew her and the local community. The service was spoken mostly in Polish with an English-translated leaflet. In an English language eulogy, her friend Anna Zimand, said: ""The horrors she saw and the conditions she had to endure are indescribable. ""That she was able to survive shows what strength of character she had."" Ms Zimand said Mrs Kaczan was ""remarkably active"" and was ""such a staunch supporter"" of her local Polish church. She said she received congratulations from the Pope for her 100th birthday, which she celebrated with friends. ""She was still looking forward to her life and whatever milestones were yet to come,"" she said. ""Zofija's spirit is present here and I know that she would be so touched by the kindness... the prayers. ""She would have wanted to say thank you to the people who cared for her... and all of you who have come to pay your respects."" Mr Waszkiewicz, 39, of Hilary Road, Shepherds Bush, will stand trial on 3 December at Derby Crown Court. Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on Twitter, or on Instagram.

input: Many villagers are already cut off by floods and Somerset County Council said its priority was to keep people safe. Sedgemoor District Council has made the same announcement so it can also mobilise extra support. The area's MP said there was a risk of catastrophic flooding unless action was taken and he asked for government help. A major incident is declared where there is a situation which could not be dealt with easily by the local council and could threaten lives, disrupt the community or damage property. It means the local authority can organise emergency evacuations, set up rest centres and mobilise voluntary organisations. He said there were fears that rain at the weekend could cause problems for Langport and Westonzoyland. The Met Office has issued an amber warning for rain on Sunday saying people living on the Somerset Levels should ""be prepared for further flooding"". Somerset County Council said its decision to declare a major incident followed the forecasts of further heavy rain, coupled with high spring tides next week. Ian Liddell-Grainger, the Conservative MP for Bridgwater, said the county faced a ""very difficult weekend"". He has written to Prime Minster David Cameron and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles asking for help. ""There is a very real risk of catastrophic flooding on a scale not seen for more than a century unless we act swiftly and decisively,"" he said. ""I have told the prime minister we need extra pumping capacity brought here as soon as possible and we may also need help from the military if the situation progresses in the way it appears to be going."" 'Urgent situation' Deputy chief executive of Somerset County Council Pat Flaherty said: ""Our priority has to be to keep people safe. ""We are doing everything we can to do this and we believe that declaring a major incident shows just how urgent the situation is for many of our residents and communities."" The council said it will continue its current help and support for people affected by flooding, including providing a boat service for the cut-off community of Muchelney and Thorney. It will also be providing a pontoon bridge at Langport and supporting farmers providing a vital tractor service to communities. Kerry Rickards, of Sedgemoor District Council, said: ""Several Sedgemoor communities have been severely affected by the floodwaters for some weeks now. ""With significant rainfall expected over the coming days we feel this situation needs to be escalated as a major incident."" Sedgemoor District Council said it had dealt with two major incidents before, one in 2011 when a river wall partially collapsed in Bridgwater, leading to the evacuation of nearby homes and 19 people spending the night in emergency accommodation. It said the second incident was in 2012 when homes were evacuated in Burnham-on-Sea after police found highly-explosive chemicals in a man's shed. For this incident, it has provided portable toilets where septic tanks have overflowed and delivered extra sandbags on top of the 3,000 already given out. The village of Muchelney in south Somerset has been cut off for almost a month. A pontoon has been built there to help villagers board a boat which has been used for transport along flooded roads.

input: Leanne Wood needed second preference votes to be the party's number one candidate on the South Wales Central list for the 2016 assembly election. Labour called it ""embarrassing"". But Plaid deputy leader Elin Jones said Ms Wood's narrow victory over Cardiff councillor Neil McEvoy was simply due to a ""very competitive election"". As well as 40 constituency members, the assembly includes 20 AMs elected from five regional lists to give a more proportional result. Topping the South Wales Central regional list - as she did in 2011 - makes Ms Wood's re-election to the assembly more likely. 'Strong candidates' Sources say Mr McEvoy led after the first round of voting on Saturday, but was eventually runner-up to Ms Wood after members' second preferences were taken into account. Dafydd Trystan was chosen as third candidate on the list. Speaking at Plaid Cymru's weekly news conference in Cardiff Bay on Tuesday, Ms Jones denied any embarrassment for Ms Wood or the party at the way the candidates were selected. She said she ""wasn't surprised"" by the closeness of the result, adding that Ms Wood would be ""ably assisted by two very strong candidates in the second and third slots as well ... I feel and see and hear no unease with any of that"".

input: By Ian YoungsEntertainment & arts reporter Running an independent bookshop can be a challenge at the best of times, trying to compete with the might of Amazon and the supermarkets. In recent years, things had been looking up, however, with 890 on our high streets in 2019, up from 867 three years earlier. They took a major hit during lockdown, but most have reopened (except in Scotland) in time for Independent Bookshop Week, which runs until Saturday. Many found new ways to reach readers while their doors were shut, but their long-term futures are still in the balance. ""As yet we have no idea how many retail casualties may result from the crisis,"" said Meryl Halls, head of the Booksellers Association. 'We're still very far from out of the woods' Bookbugs and Dragon Tales in Norwich had only been open for seven months when it was forced to shut again. ""We hadn't factored a global pandemic into the business plan, surprisingly,"" owner Leanne Fridd laughs. She thought about getting a job in a supermarket when the virus struck, but decided to try to keep the business going, making the most of one thing an Amazon algorithm can't match - a personal touch. She put together home-school packs, bundling together educational, activity and story books based on each child's interests and age. She also created adult escape packs with a personalised selection of novels plus relaxing treats and mindful activities. She and husband Dan also made their online store more prominent and ran online storytelling sessions and book groups. ""When people are at home and the internet is just there, we are fully aware that people have an alternative, and potentially a cheaper alternative, and we can't possibly match that. No independent bookshop can,"" she says. ""All indies try and offer something that goes a little bit further. We know your children, we watch them grow, we care about your family. So we felt it was really important to say, 'We're still here for you', and people have been responding to that quite nicely."" Even so, turnover was only 20% of the pre-pandemic level. She furloughed both members of staff and wasn't eligible for the government's self-employment support. The shop reopened last week, with the necessary safety measures and reduced hours. In the afternoons, customers can book a 15-minute slot to have the shop to themselves, their bubble or family. ""They don't have to worry about social distancing from anyone apart from us, and we're obviously suited and booted,"" she says. ""That's been really effective because a lot of the families have said, 'This is the first time we've brought our children out, this is the first shop we've been into'."" The future is still uncertain, she says. ""We're still very far from out of the woods but the bigger fear was that we wouldn't be able to survive - and still is. But we try and be really optimistic and positive and do everything we can. ""If we don't survive, it won't be because we haven't poured our heart and soul into everything, trying so many different ways to help people feel engaged with us."" 'It couldn't have been timed worse' When lockdown was imposed, The Rabbit Hole in Brigg, Lincolnshire, didn't have an online shop to speak of, and decided it wasn't worth trying to create one at short notice. ""We concentrated on other things and just tried to get through,"" says Nick Webb, who runs the shop with wife Mel. ""We worked with a lot of authors and a lot of kids' groups doing Zoom sessions. We're heavily involved with schools - we're both ex-teachers - so every week we were doing that. It was another way that we kept in contact with people."" The authors who took part included Richard O'Neill, Katie Brosnan and Onjali Q Rauf. ""We try to improve the diversity of books that go out to kids, so it's not just what they see on - how shall I phrase this - big online retailers, and in the supermarkets,"" Webb explains. ""They all spent time talking to the kids on Zoom about books and illustrations - you name it, they talked about it. And it worked really well. ""And we don't know how it happened, but a little lad from South Korea joined. He asked his mum for permission, because it's midnight in South Korea when it's 4pm here."" Brigg is a market town, so The Rabbit Hole took over a stall when outdoor markets were allowed to reopen from 1 June, two weeks before the shop itself. The shop originally opened three years ago. The Webbs were not eligible for the government's self-employment support, which gives 80% of average monthly profits based on the past three years. The shop didn't make a profit for the first two years because they had spent money on the building and stock, Webb explains. When the shop shut in March, the couple couldn't be sure if it would open again. ""It's been really difficult, and now it's crossed fingers and let's hope we can rebuild it,"" he says. ""It was just the wrong time. It couldn't have been timed worse for us personally. ""It was very precarious and still is. We will just have to see how we go over the next few months. It will be close, but we're pretty determined."" 'The amount of work has been phenomenal' Linghams in Heswall, Merseyside, used to get around two-thirds of its income from events where authors would come and read and sell their books in person, owner Sue Porter estimates. When lockdown began, she came up with an idea to replicate that online, along with three other independent booksellers. The Facebook page for At Home with 4 Indies has so far hosted conversations with Marian Keyes, Joe Wicks and Ian Rankin, with sessions during Independent Bookshop Week culminating with Bernardine Evaristo on Friday. ""The amount of work that goes into it and getting everybody set up on tech and promoting it has been quite phenomenal to be honest,"" Porter says. ""But we have pulled it out of the bag. ""It was all about community - to make sure we could provide an hour of relief for our customers, and then if we managed to get the book, they would have several hours of relief after that away from the coronavirus."" They have struggled on occasion to get stock of an author's new book, and online sales have not matched the numbers that would normally be stacked on a shop counter. ""It doesn't compare,"" she says. ""It's a little bit more now, but we're miles away from how much we originally sold at our real-life events."" Having built up a following with their free online events, the four shops will start running paid-for author webcasts from September. Customers will get a ticket if they order the book. The four shop owners have been supporting each other the past three months. ""It has been hard, and it's been emotional,"" Porter says. ""If I was having a bad day, the other girls would get in touch with me and vice versa. The emotional struggle has been absolutely huge."" She furloughed her seven staff when lockdown was imposed, and reopened the shop on Monday, a week later than many places, because of work being done to the shop's cafe. ""I haven't had a day off since March when it [lockdown] started,"" she says. ""So I'm looking forward to getting some staff back and maybe taking my foot off the pedal.""

input: By James LandaleDiplomatic correspondent It has raised fears among MPs that the reduction could be permanent. There had been speculation the chancellor was proposing a temporary, one-off cut to help pay down the government's record deficit. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the UK is ""a leading, if not one of the leading, countries on aid"" and ""that will continue"". The idea behind a temporary cut was to reduce aid spending next year to just 0.5% of national income, down from the legally binding target of 0.7%. But the BBC understands that Rishi Sunak's reforms will require new legislation to be passed by Parliament, which MPs believe implies a permanent cut to the aid target or even its abolition. The issue is that the 0.7% baseline for Britain's aid budget is enshrined in law by the International Development (Official Development Assistance Target) Act. This does allow the government to miss the target in certain circumstances, such as if there is a substantial change in the country's national income. Foreign and Development Secretary Dominic Raab is simply required to lay a report before Parliament explaining why he has missed the target. But there is a growing belief at Westminster that this exemption can apply only retrospectively. The act places a duty on Mr Raab to ensure the 0.7% target is met. If he misses it, the act requires him to describe what steps he has taken to ensure the target is met the following year. Some MPs and charities believe these two provisions mean the government cannot declare in advance its intention to miss the target without breaking the law. To cut the aid budget without fresh legislation might lay the decision open to judicial review. MPs also believe that a one-off cut to the aid target - a saving of about £4bn - would hardly touch the sides of the £350bn deficit projected for this year. They say it only makes sense for the Treasury if the cut is permanent. They also believe that if the government is going to reduce aid spending and face significant political and international criticism, ministers will be tempted to go the whole hog and scrap the target entirely. Almost 200 charities, two former prime ministers, opposition parties, church leaders, ex-heads of the armed forces, global philanthropists have all come out against the cuts. The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson not to go ahead with cuts, saying that ""helping the world's poorest is one of the great moral and ethical achievements of our country"". The risk for the government is that passing new legislation would give critics of the aid cut the chance to oppose and potentially block the changes in Parliament. Although the government has a working majority of more than 80, it has seen a number of rebellions of late. One senior Tory MP said defeating the government on this ""would be entirely doable"". Such is the scale of the reforms to the aid target that Mr Raab is expected to make a statement to MPs about it on Thursday.

Organiser Oz Osbourne said the group wanted to show the opposition to plans for the airport to cater for 12m passengers by the mid-2020s. He said he had not flown for 20 years and was urging other to take the ""flight-free pledge"" for 2020. ""If you join the flight-free pledge then it changes the way you think about who you are... and [you'll] have a greener lifestyle. An airport spokesman said flights ""were operating as normal"" but advised passengers to allow extra time for their journeys.

input: By Gemma HandyZorg-En-Vlygt, Essequibo Coast, Guyana The bright welcoming venue, framed by rice paddies, looks the picture of pastoral contentment. But behind its creation lies an unsettling reality. This upbeat community centre was built to address the devastating number of suicides both here on the scenic Essequibo Coast - and in Guyana itself, which holds the dubious distinction of the highest suicide rate in the world. World Health Organization figures claim 44.2 in every 100,000 Guyanese take their own lives, compared to a global average of 16. Shining a light on suicide The Guyana Foundation, the charity behind the Sunrise Center in Zorg-En-Vlygt, has been integral in dragging the phenomenon into the national conversation in a country where stigma surrounding mental health issues has long hindered efforts to alleviate them. A lack of adequate mainstream facilities and woefully outdated legislation - which still defines patients as ""idiots"" suffering ""derangement"" - are just some of the obstacles, says the centre's managing director Anthony Autar. Attempted suicide is still technically illegal in Guyana, carrying a custodial sentence of two years, although measures are under way to decriminalise it. ""When considering mental health issues, we also look at people's ability to contribute to society,"" Mr Autar tells the BBC. ""Learning a skill like catering or floral arrangement can improve their sense of worth and outlook for the future."" Dress-making, tie-dye and yoga are also among the free courses open to the public at the facility which launched operations in June, ahead of its official October 29 opening. ""We often find people who come here are isolated and don't have many strong connections. We encourage students to build friendships with each other; those relationships can help save someone's life if they're feeling suicidal,"" Mr Autar adds. Attendees are routinely invited to complete questionnaires assessing their emotional wellbeing and are informed about the free counselling services offered. It's part of a proactive approach to tackle depression, anxiety and low self-esteem, and remove stigma by teaching people such feelings ""are as common as diabetes"", says counsellor Haimraj Hamandeo. Participants are predominantly aged 25 to 45, and 75% are female. ""Females are more open to assistance,"" Mr Hamandeo continues. ""They're also more likely to attempt suicide; men are more likely to be successful at it."" Opinion on just why Guyana tops the global suicide list is divided. A panel discussion organised by the University of Guyana to mark World Suicide Prevention Day in September cited relationship issues, political upheavals, poverty and high crime as contributory factors. Indo-Guyanese account for 80% of suicides, despite making up just 40% of the population in the six-race nation. Most are aged 15 to 34, with almost four men to each female. Poisoning by agricultural pesticides accounts for 65% of cases while one in five is by hanging. For each successful suicide, there's up to 25 more attempted cases, says Dr Bhiro Harry, head of psychiatry at Georgetown Public Hospital. ""Many Indo-Guyanese are farmers so they have easy access to lethal pesticides,"" he explains. ""Culturally, Indo-Guyanese folks are 'babied'. For example, I have three children in their 20s all living at home; I still make my son's breakfast every morning. Afro-Guyanese tend to have less close families and are taught to be strong and resilient."" Conversely, social science lecturer Paulette Henry thinks ""broken families"" is a prime cause. After being personally touched by suicide when a close friend killed himself, she testifies to the emotions affecting those left behind too. ""I dealt with anger, pain, a sense of loss and guilt,"" she says, ""as a social worker I felt I should have recognised the signs."" Public Health Minister Dr George Norton describes Guyana's existing national psychiatric hospital as ""not fit for human consumption"". He told the BBC mental health was his ""personal priority"" and that a national suicide prevention plan was currently being devised. That includes training additional psychiatrists and the creation of a psycho-social rehabilitation venue. Back at the Sunrise Center, Mr Hamandeo says engagement in ""productive"" activities had seen great successes. ""Often people find an ability they didn't know they had. You see a change in the way they communicate, the way they greet you, their extra energy."" That is music to the ears of centre founder Supriya Singh Bodden who must raise $3,500 (£2,850) a month from donations to run the facility - and plans to establish more across the country. ""I got so depressed reading about the suicides every day, I just wanted to bring some hope into communities suffering poverty and lack of opportunity,"" she explains. ""If we can touch people's lives in a positive way so they want to live to see another sunrise, then we have achieved something.""

The Prison Service said inmates in the affected wing have been transferred to other prisons. A spokeswoman said a ""full assessment"" of the 560-capacity Victorian jail would be carried out. Mobile phone footage subsequently emerged of inmates knocking through weak cell walls and rioting inside the Category B prison. It showed prisoners dancing and running around the walkways, with some holding batons and one squirting a hose. The Prison Service said 150 inmates, including 19 involved in the incident, have been transferred to other prisons. A spokeswoman said those involved would face prison adjudication hearings as well as an investigation by the police. ""We are taking action to improve and modernise our jails - just last week the prime minister announced up to £2.5bn to create 10,000 new prison places,"" she added. The MoJ previously confirmed that inmates broke out of their cells at the prison by ""manipulating weaknesses"" in the mortar with furniture. It said pepper spray was used to subdue two prisoners and four were taken to hospital.

input: By Celia HattonBBC News, Beijing Li Keqiang, the premier of China, faced that question as he delivered a lengthy speech marking the start of China's annual parliamentary session. At the heart of the speech: Beijing's forecast of 7% GDP growth in the coming year. Many other politicians would be thrilled to unveil that figure. But for China, it's a let-down after years of double digit expansion. So, how did Mr Li break the news? Very carefully, it seems. First, the state media spent weeks priming audiences to accept the ""new normal"" of slower economic growth. Moderate growth is a good thing, experts explained, because it indicates China is becoming a more mature, balanced economy. So, there was little surprise when Mr Li referenced the ""new normal"" when speaking about the coming year. The premier also took pains to show that he was in touch with the real problems facing the economy. Using plain-spoken language, in Chinese and in the official English translation, he admitted that investment was ""sluggish"" and the country's growth model was ""inefficient"". The government's work must be improved in many areas, he noted, conceding ""a small number of government employees behave irresponsibly, shocking cases of corruption still exist; and some government officials are neglectful of their duties."" With self-flagellation about the past out of the way, the premier turned to the future. He outlined ways that China's leaders are planning to restructure the economy by reducing price controls and overhauling the opaque tax system. Ten million new jobs will be created in China's cities, the premier promised, and the state would continue to fund ambitious stimulus projects. Few of the ideas outlined in the work report were new; but Li Keqiang reaffirmed the government's commitment to reform. Lastly, Mr Li made things easier for himself next year by warning that this slower rate of GDP growth would continue indefinitely. ""If China's economy can grow at this rate for a relatively long time,"" he explained, ""we will secure a more solid material foundation for modernisation."" In other words, the ""new normal"" shouldn't raise eyebrows next year.

If left to thrive, thousands of tiny plants can accumulate and starve the waterway of oxygen and sunlight. The trust is asking people to report any sightings of the weed, which is not harmful to humans. Recent sunshine has seen duck weed spread rapidly through the region's waterways and while each individual piece is tiny, it has left ""a thick carpet across the canal"", the trust said. Dogs and other animals have been known to mistake duck weed for grass ""and ended up in the water"", trust spokesman Diane Rollin said. Litter can also gather in the weed and cause problems for boats. Described as being ""like a garden lawn, pea soup, or even green porridge"", if left to flourish ""it can cause problems for other aquatic wildlife by starving it of oxygen and sunlight"", she said. Teams have cleared a mile-long section of the Lancaster Canal, between Hollinshead Fold Bridge and Ashton Basin, the trust said.

input: By Reevel AldersonBBC Scotland's social affairs correspondent A report said there was a big disparity between people in the most deprived areas compared to those in more affluent parts. Cancer charities called for more resources for deprived areas. The figures for the Detect Cancer Early (DCE) programme showed a small rise in the number of people diagnosed early. DCE was launched by the Scottish Government in 2012 to raise the public's awareness of the national cancer screening programmes and also the early signs and symptoms of cancer to encourage help to be sought earlier. Figures for the two years 2017 and 2018 showed that for the three most common forms of the disease - breast, lung and colorectal cancer - one in four (25.5%) was diagnosed at the earliest stage (stage 1). That was an increase of 9.4% in the seven years of the programme. Disparity However, the report highlighted the difference in experiences of people in poor areas and those in more affluent areas. Looking at the three most common cancers, 22.6% of those in the most deprived areas were diagnosed at stage 1 compared with 29.1% in the least deprived areas. Gordon Matheson of the charity Cancer Research UK said: ""It's welcome that DCE has seen a small increase in the number of people in Scotland being diagnosed early with cancer. ""However, it remains unacceptable that those living in Scotland's poorer communities have significantly less chance of being diagnosed at an early stage when treatment is more likely to be successful. ""For this to change it's essential we see more tailored resources being targeted at Scotland's poorer communities. ""The Scottish government must also ensure that there's enough staff to do this vital work, if we are to meet current and future need."" Over the seven years DCE has been in place there has been a rise in patients diagnosed at stage 1 with breast cancer - although there has been a small drop since 2014. The percentage of patients diagnosed at stage 1 for colorectal cancer has fallen over the time period although it has risen since 2016. Lung cancer has seen an increase in patients diagnosed at stage 1 although the increases have flattened over the last few years. Survival rates The report also showed for patients diagnosed with breast, colorectal or lung cancer in the most deprived areas of Scotland, the highest proportion were diagnosed at the most advanced stage of disease; stage 4 (29.7%). For those living in the least deprived areas, the highest proportion were diagnosed at stage 2 (29.6%). Scotland's Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick said early detection was crucial to continuing the improvement in survival rates with deaths from the disease down 10% in a decade. He said: ""More than £200m will deliver six elective treatment centres to allow people to be diagnosed and treated more quickly for planned surgery. ""Our DCE Programme has been developed to remind people across Scotland of their resilience and strength, in the hope that they'll act early to give themselves the best chance of finding cancer early. ""We are continuing to tackle variations in early detection rates, committing over £1m to health boards and third sector organisations since 2016, through our Health Inequalities Fund to improve screening uptake in groups least likely to participate. ""We are working to beat cancer, investing over £100m in our strategy as well as an additional £14m supporting health boards reduce waiting times.""

input: By Milton NkosiBBC News, Johannesburg Nkosazana Clarice Dlamini-Zuma, 68 - a senior member of the governing African National Congress (ANC) - has been criss-crossing the country in recent months seeking a mandate to be its first woman president. Since returning from a five-year stint in Addis Ababa running the African Union, Ms Dlamini-Zuma has addressed crowds at events from funerals to political rallies. The eldest of eight children, she was born in the rolling hills of KwaZulu-Natal province in 1949 and joined the underground anti-apartheid student movement in the early 1970s while at medical school there. This raised the ire of the apartheid regime. She was forced to flee into exile and eventually completed her studies at Bristol University in the UK in 1978. 'In the claws of the ex-husband' The newly qualified Ms Dlamini-Zuma worked at Mbabane Government Hospital in Swaziland. This is where she met and was charmed by Mr Zuma, then also an exiled member of the ANC. Mr Zuma is a polygamist, and she was one of his three wives until she divorced him in 1998. Ms Dlamini-Zuma, who had four children with her ex-husband, never remarried. Nevertheless, President Zuma, who steps down as party leader in December, has endorsed her to succeed him as ANC president, and preferably of the country after elections due in 2019. Pressure has been increasing on him to step down earlier amid accusations of corruption, which he denies. Asked whether she should rise to the very top of the political landscape, he said: ""She has grown in the struggle. She has run a number of positions. She has been a minister in a number of departments, there's no question at all. ""If the ANC says we think we can give this responsibility and she agrees, then that's not a concern at all."" Who is Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma? She reported the local Sunday Times newspaper to the independent press council after it quoted unnamed sources in January as saying that she was spending ""a lot of time"" at the president's rural homestead. The council ordered the newspaper to apologise for presenting the allegation ""as fact in its headline"". Her lawyers had dismissed the report as ""untruthful, inaccurate and unfair"", and accused the newspaper of publishing a ""bizarre story that an African woman, despite divorcing her husband to whom she had been married in terms of the Civil Law, remains in the claws of the ex-husband in the name of polygamy"". A former leader of the women's wing of the ANC, she had the confidence of South Africa's first black president, Nelson Mandela, who appointed her as health minister after the end of white minority rule in 1994. She was widely credited with introducing legislation which made it illegal for people to smoke in public areas such as restaurants and airports. Her tenure as health minister was followed by a 10-year stint as foreign minister, during the rule of Mr Mandela's successor - and Mr Zuma's rival - Thabo Mbeki. Mr Mbeki had offered her the post of deputy president after he sacked Mr Zuma in 2005, following allegations of corruption against him. 'Walking with the wolves' The rise of NDZ - as she is sometimes referred to nowadays - has not come without controversy. While health minister she became embroiled in the first big corruption scandal to hit the ANC government. Her department awarded a 14 million rand ($1,2m; £700,00) tender to renowned playwright Mbongeni Ngema to come up with a sequel to Sarafina, a musical to educate people about the dangers of HIV/Aids. Following a public outcry over the huge cost of the musical, an anti-corruption body - the public protector's office - carried out an investigation. It led to the termination of the contract. ""Mr Ngema's company had not adhered fully to the spirit and terms of the contract, and it appeared they had tendered a defective service,"" the public protector's office said. Ms Dlamini-Zuma refused to resign, despite pressure from the opposition. Also as health minister, she was criticised for supporting Virodene, a toxic substance which had been rejected by the wider scientific community, as a remedy for HIV/Aids. After spending most of her life fighting for the downtrodden, she has uncharacteristically chosen to walk with the wolves during the current campaign. Some of her current backers have a litany of corruption scandals hanging around their necks. Many of her old comrades are irked by her political expediency, even if it is for the top job in Africa's most industrialised economy. 'My own woman' More recently, she was chastised for labelling nationwide protests calling for President Zuma to step down as ""rubbish"" in a tweet which was then deleted from her timeline. Some said Mr Zuma was trying to protect himself from prosecution over corruption allegations, because if his former wife becomes president, she would be reluctant to send the police to lock him up during his retirement in his village of Nkandla. However NDZ was incensed at the suggestion she wants to be president in order to protect her former husband from his legal woes. She said: ""I am my own woman and I have worked hard to be here,"" she told the Johannesburg Star newspaper. ""I have my own track record in the ANC and in government. I am a doctor and one of the longest-serving cabinet ministers under former Presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki. Before Zuma became president,"" she was quoted as saying. Those who know her well describe Ms Dlamini-Zuma as firm, controlling and someone who at times tells it like it is. But at home some of her stories are of a motherly figure. Even though there are other women aspiring to the number one spot, she has become the face of the ANC Women's League's call that ""South Africa is ready for a woman president."" The diminutive figure I have come to know over the years is a humble and intellectually astute individual. But unlike her former husband, her personality cannot be described as charming. But the question is whether the people will follow her as she continues to soldier on towards the presidential seat.

input: By David LumbBBC News, West Midlands Now, as Jaguar Land Rover announces plans to create an extra 1,700 jobs at its base in Solihull - on top of 800 created in January - is the West Midlands town becoming ""Land Rover Land""? Discovery, Defender, and Freelander models line the leafy cul-de-sacs that surround the plant on the outskirts of the town centre. Families talk about the difficulty of finding their cars in supermarket car parks because there are now so many of the same cars from the same company. 'Status vehicle' Even Solihull Council is in on the act, with the mayoral car being - of course - a black 2013 Range Rover Vogue. ""Suddenly they are everywhere, throughout the streets of Solihull,"" said mayor Joe Tildesley. ""I look out the window and it's the first car I see. It's a status vehicle people aspire to have. ""They are here and are - quite properly - endorsed by many people, including the council. I don't see it as a bad thing."" Mother-of-three Julie Henn, lives in Nerstal Drive in Solihull, just a stone's throw away from the Jaguar Land Rover site. The 55-year-old said she regretted leaving her Land Rover behind so much when she moved to the UK from South Africa about eight years ago that she ended up buying a replacement soon afterwards. Her husband is now hoping to buy a new one as well. ""There was not a day that went by when I did not regret it,"" she said. ""Now I can't believe how many there are. On Saturday I saw four in a row. ""A Range Rover, two Discoveries and a Freelander - one after the other."" 'Confidence booster' Mrs Henn said she knew people who struggled to find their Land Rovers in supermarket car parks because they were so common. Mother-of two Joanne Rumney, who lives around the corner in Oakslade Drive, owns a Land Rover Discovery from the 1990s. ""People are proud to have JLR here,"" said the 38-year-old. ""It has a status that people like. They are good family cars."" Jaguar Land Rover, which also has manufacturing bases in Castle Bromwich and Halewood on Merseyside, has said the latest announcement will bring the total number of jobs it has created in the UK over the past three years to almost 11,000. Mr Tildesley said the firm's investment had ""undoubtedly"" boosted Solihull with other firms benefiting from knock-on trade. Rachael Eade, from the Manufacturing Advisory Service, said every job created by vehicle manufacturers leads to two or three in the supply chain. ""It's a huge confidence booster locally and UK-wide,"" she said. ""It's 1,700 jobs and three times that in the supply chain. ""I think the new technology involved will attract a new, younger market and will make a difference to the supply chain. ""Younger people have more of a desire to be involved in that as they probably view car manufacturing to be a bit dusty, dirty and not for them."" But not everyone is happy. Some shops said the expansion had brought with it increased parking problems. Terry Cosma, manager of Solihull Fish Bar in Hob's Moat Road, said: ""I have not noticed any change in business. We have always had a steady flow of JLR workers. ""The big problem is the lack of parking round here. They are along the pavements, the grass verges, sometimes it's difficult to get into the side roads."" Julie Jones, who works at Trev's Hairdressers, also in Hob's Moat Road, said: ""The parking is ridiculous - diabolical. ""There is nowhere for us to go because all the Land Rover workers are there."" In 2005, MG Rover based at Longbridge, less than 10 miles from Solihull, went into administration. About 14,000 people employed by the Rover group were based at the site. But Ms Eade said she did not believe Solihull would suffer a similar fate and collapse if JLR's fortunes changed in the future. ""The automotive industry has learnt lessons from MG Rover,"" she said. ""They are not as heavily reliant on one customer now and if you are a designer you probably work for JLR, Mini, JCB, Ford. ""I don't think the bubble will burst for the foreseeable future.""

input: By Deborah Cohen & Jake MorrisBBC Newsnight A study by Sheffield council shows people in low-paid jobs, with insecure contracts, who couldn't afford to isolate have been hardest hit by the disease in the city. The council split its population into 10 income brackets, from the wealthiest to the most deprived, and looked at Covid case rates in each group. While the rates were generally greater among the less well-off, they were highest of all in the third income group, rather than the poorest or second poorest. ""The impact is really on the working poor,"" said Sheffield's director of public health, Greg Fell. This group is ""most likely to be low paid"", on insecure contracts and unable to afford to isolate. ""Transmission in that group of people is much higher,"" said Mr Fell. Patrick Meleady recognises the impact first-hand, from his work with a food bank in east Sheffield. ""People here work in factories, are care workers, bus drivers and taxi drivers,"" said Mr Meleady. ""So they're on the front line having an interaction,"" he said. ""If you're in another area and you're more affluent and you've got a different career path, you're going to remove yourself from that [risk of Covid]."" The findings are supported by further research carried out by Sheffield City Council, which mapped Covid case rates as they spread across the urban population in the first wave. The mapping, in the animated video below, shows that at the start, cases appeared among people living in the wealthier west of the city, driven perhaps by those returning from half-term ski trips. It then spread and remained stubbornly embedded in the poorer east. By the end of June, as national case numbers plummeted and England emerged from its first lockdown, the majority of new positive cases were confined to the most deprived area of the city. These poorer areas have continued to experience high rates of Covid in the second wave too. The fact the disease has affected poorer areas more than wealthy ones in the UK has been well recorded. Work by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows those living in the most deprived neighbourhoods are more than twice as likely to die from Covid as those in the least deprived. But Greg Fell is ""surprised by the starkness"" of what the council found in Sheffield. ""It was always going to be something that was only unevenly or unequally split,"" he said. It's not just jobs that play a role in Covid risks. Poor housing has been known as a factor for some time. A recent study of housing conditions looked at how the number of people living in a house, and the number of rooms, affected Covid risk. The research, run by University College London's Virus Watch team, found a clear link. Overcrowded households ""had twice the risk of coronavirus infection compared to people living in un-crowded households,"" said Prof Rob Aldridge who runs the study. The high verses low income split in Covid cases is consistent with existing differences in health in Sheffield. The difference in life expectancy can be as much as 20 years, says Dr Jennie Joyce, a GP working in the city. And existing illnesses, such as diabetes and heart disease, may mean people getting sicker from Covid. She's not surprised by the impact. ""I think we did know that on the ground. It just wasn't coming down from the top,"" she said. A report prepared by Sheffield's Citizens Advice Bureau shows those who were already struggling pre-Covid are in a worse position now. It cites factors including not being able to travel to cheaper food shops and higher heating and lighting costs from being at home, and it warns the poor have got into greater debt. Gulnaz Hussain, who works at Firvale Community Hub, says money is always tight for people in the nearby area. And when work is always uncertain for many in the city, Covid can feel like one more thing ""We have community and community resilience, and being able to know how to cope in difficult situations,"" says Ms Husain. ""This is just another one of those risks."" Watch Deborah Cohen's report for Newsnight on BBC iPlayer (UK only).

input: By Michael Cowan & Livvy HaydockBBC File on 4 Jamie - not his real name - is in his early 20s . For the last few years he made money by scamming women, usually those a lot older than him, who were looking for love. He did this while in prison for an unrelated crime, using an illegal mobile phone he had hidden. He was recently released and spoke to the BBC's File on 4 programme. He says he will not commit the fraud again, and wants to make amends by exposing some of his tactics to serve as a warning to others. 'It was work' ""It was a last resort kind of thing, I just saw how easy it was,"" Jamie says. ""The most I ever got from a girl was £10,000... every week she was sending me £100, £200. ""I've forgotten her name now, I don't see it as a relationship, I [saw] it as work."" He says his accounts were blocked after the victims reported them, but he was never punished for the frauds. He says people using dating apps should watch out for men contacting them who are a lot younger or ""better looking"", who start asking for money, especially if they have never met in person. Jamie says he picked his targets by looking for those he thought likely to be lonely and lacking attention from others on the apps. His theory was that they would be more willing to ""do anything"" to avoid risk losing the connection. And he says he would use his real photographs, confident that his looks would help lure victims in. ""I would go for older women and look for the desperation,"" he says. ""Keywords would be like 'I just want happiness' or something like that. I'll act cool at the start and if she talks back then I know she's interested just from my pictures. ""From then, that's when I start putting my game on, selling you dreams like 'I want a kid with you.' ""[I] just say everything that she wants to hear until she's fallen in love."" Until he felt that his victim was emotionally attached, Jamie said he wouldn't tell them he was in prison. He claims that he often messaged women for months, charming them before revealing the fact. When he did, he says he lied about the reason he was jailed, telling women it was for driving offences rather than violent crime. 'He was charming' In 2020, there were nearly 7,000 reports of so-called romance fraud. It cost victims almost £70m last year. And according to trade association UK Finance, there has been a 20% increase in bank transfers relating to romance fraud during the pandemic. Di Pogson, a 59-year-old widow, gave away her entire life savings of £40,000 to someone she met on a dating app. It turned out to be a scam. The man she'd fallen for did not really exist. He was the creation of three fraudsters who preyed on vulnerable women across southern England. ""I always had in the back of my mind that I would never, ever be conned. I was too savvy,"" she says. ""But then 'Kevin' came along and he was charming. He was interested in me. ""It started off at just under £500 for his vet bills, and the sums gradually went up. ""When I completely ran out of money, he called me all sorts of names, he stopped answering his phone. ""Alarm bells rang and I went to the police."" She says she felt gullible and stupid. ""I told the children. It was horrible having to tell them I had lost so much money to somebody I had never met."" PC Bernadette Laurie, a financial abuse safeguarding officer, says many of the cases reported to police last year happened during lockdown, when people felt more lonely than usual. Victims often discovered they had been fooled, she adds, when the criminals failed to meet up after the restrictions eased. She recommends following advice by Action Fraud. How to spot a scam These behaviours could signal your prospective partner is not what they claim to be: One way of checking on photos can be to do a reverse image search via Google Images, Bing Visual Search, TinEye or another similar service. Twenty-five of the UK's police forces also provided data in response to a freedom of information request made by File on 4. This suggested that of the country's most popular dating apps, Tinder, Plenty of Fish and Grindr were the ones most associated with crime reports between 2018 and 2020. Over this time, the number of crime reports associated with dating apps rose by 24% to 903 reports last year. This is only a partial data set. Eighteen forces, including some of the country's biggest like the Metropolitan Police, Greater Manchester Police, PSNI, and Police Scotland, did not provide data, meaning the actual crime numbers are likely to be significantly higher. The File on 4 documentary The Dangers of Dating Apps will be broadcast at 20:00 on Radio 4, Tuesday 23 February and then be available on BBC Sounds

input: The Labour leader told students in London he wanted a society ""where we don't automatically criminalise people"", The Guardian reported. Ex-Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said prostitution was ""exploitation and abuse"" not ""an industry"". Labour sources said Mr Corbyn had been answering a direct question, not making a policy announcement. They added that he believed sex workers should not be seen as criminals. 'More civilised' The Labour leader had been taking part in a question and answer session at Goldsmiths University, in London, on Thursday. According to the Guardian, he said: ""I am in favour of decriminalising the sex industry. I don't want people to be criminalised. I want to be [in] a society where we don't automatically criminalise people. ""Let's do things a bit differently and in a bit more civilised way."" In 2014, Northern Ireland became the first part of the UK to pass legislation making the purchase of sexual services illegal. In the rest of the UK, paying for sex is not against the law but many activities linked to it, such as brothel-keeping, kerb-crawling and soliciting sex in a public place, are outlawed. 'Exploitation' Backbench Labour MP Jess Phillips criticised Mr Corbyn's comments on Twitter. ""Man says we should decriminalize a known violence against women. Why did it have to be this man,"" she wrote. But the English Collective of Prostitutes, which campaigns for decriminalisation, voiced its support for Mr Corbyn's comments. Supporters of decriminalisation include Amnesty International, which says it would mean sex workers are ""no longer forced to live outside the law"". Ms Harman tweeted: ""Prostitution's exploitation and abuse not ""work/an industry"". Women should be protected and men prosecuted."" An attempt by former Labour Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart to change the law to criminalise paying for sex was defeated in 2014. Sex workers had criticised the proposal, saying criminalising their clients will make their work more dangerous.

input: A small bowl bought for just $35 (£25) at a market sale in the US state of Connecticut has turned out to be a rare 15th-Century Chinese artefact. The white porcelain bowl was spotted by an unidentified antiques enthusiast near New Haven last year, and they quickly sought an expert evaluation. The experts came back with good news, revealing that the bowl is thought to be worth between $300,000 and $500,000. In fact, it is believed to be one of only seven such bowls in existence and most of the others are in museums. The bowl is set to be auctioned in New York on 17 March by Sotheby's auction house, which describes the find in its listing as ""exceptional and rare"". ""It was immediately apparent to both of us that we were looking at something really very, very special,"" Angela McAteer, an expert on Chinese ceramics at the auctioneer's told the Associated Press news agency. ""The style of painting, the shape of the bowl, even just the colour of the blue is quite characteristic of that early, early 15th-Century period of porcelain,"" she added. The 6-inch (16cm) diameter bowl features cobalt blue floral paintings and an intricate design around the rim. ""All the characteristics and hallmarks are there that identify it as a product of the early Ming [Dynasty] period,"" Ms McAteer said. How exactly the bowl found itself being sold at a Connecticut outdoor sale remains a mystery. Some have suggested it may have been passed down through generations of the same family. ""It's always quite astounding to think that it kind of still happens, that these treasures can be discovered,"" Ms McAteer said. ""It's always really exciting for us as specialists when something we didn't even know existed here appears seemingly out of nowhere."" You might also be interested in:

They include 22 allegations of rape, five counts of false imprisonment, two of assault by penetration and two of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Bristol Crown Court heard the grime star raped one woman in his flat days after meeting her at a city nightclub. An interview she gave to police was played in court in which she said Mr Anokye ""just got really angry out of nowhere"" and held her against her will. ""I think he paused before like 'You gonna talk',"" she told police. ""And he says 'If you pass out, then you're gonna wake up and think you're in a horror film'."" The woman said Mr Anokye placed a cloth over her nose and mouth, which left her skin ""burning"" and red. 'Panic attack' She described how she had been wearing a coat with a large collar on, which Mr Anokye grabbed and ""pulled it tight"" around her neck. ""I don't know how long that was but I lost consciousness,"" she said. ""When I came back, I started having a panic attack, so I was breathing really fast and crying."" Mr Anokye allegedly punched and kicked the woman before raping her. Prosecutors have previously told the jury that Mr Anokye, of Millennium Promenade, Bristol, ""imprisoned, assaulted, sexually violated and raped"" the four complainants in the case. Police examining mobile phones and a laptop found at Mr Anokye's home after his arrest discovered searches for ""dacryphilia"", the court heard. Jurors have been told this is sexual arousal from another's fear. The trial continues.

Alun Davies said threatening legal action ""sounds like the last breath before you're thrown out of the pub"". Mr Davies said he was not convinced the Welsh Government would ""have a leg to stand on"" in trying to shape international trade deals after Brexit. Following Donald Trump's comments during last week's trade visit that the NHS would be ""on the table"" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was ""absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation.""

input: Many workers can expect a ""miserable Christmas"" without targeted support for employers, the union warned. The government's furlough programme will end on 31 October. A Treasury spokesperson said the government had ""not hesitated to act in creative and effective ways to support jobs and we will continue to do so"". Wednesday marks 45 days before the end of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which is the same amount of time employers must give for notice of redundancy. The call comes amid growing evidence that the winding down of the scheme is leading to more plans for job cuts. The number of firms that notified the government in June about plans to cut 20 or more jobs was five times higher than in the same month last year, figures obtained by the BBC show. A Freedom of Information request shows that in June, 1,778 firms said they were intending to cut more than 139,000 jobs in England, Wales and Scotland. In total, nine million people have been furloughed for at least one three-week period since March, However, about 695,000 UK workers have gone from the payrolls of UK companies since then and it is feared that more will follow if the government stops paying to safeguard jobs. Unite said that without ""a clear and urgent sign"" from the government that it was responding to calls to extend the scheme, it feared that ""employers facing short-term struggles will issue redundancy notices"". The government has been urged by MPs, business groups, unions and political opponents to continue the furlough programme, in which workers placed on leave receive 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of £2,500 a month. The scheme, which has cost more than £35bn, was initially funded by the government, but firms started to contribute to wages in September after the scheme began to wind down. Last week, the Treasury Select Committee said the government should consider a targeted extension of the scheme. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said a signal from the government would ""put a floor under struggling employers who are working hard to stabilise in the face of immense challenges"". ""With our competitor nations announcing the extension or modification of their jobs retention schemes, we ask that your government recognises the need for UK businesses and workers to receive similar support,"" Mr McCluskey wrote in a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. A spokeswoman said Unite wanted to see support for sectors including manufacturing, aviation infrastructure, aerospace and hospitality. The government has repeatedly rebuffed the calls for an extension to the scheme, saying that it has served its purpose in cushioning the economy during the coronavirus crisis. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said his priority is to find new ways to protect jobs. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The furlough scheme has done what it was designed to do - save jobs and help people back into employment."" The spokesperson said the government had made ""unprecedented interventions"", including firms being given £1,000 for every furloughed worker still employed in January, business rates holidays, VAT cuts and the Kickstart scheme, which gives young people jobs experience.

input: By Chloe HadjimatheouBBC World Service, Athens Emilio Papas opens the tall iron door to his squat near Exarhia Square, in the centre of Athens, to reveal an enormous five-storey building with high ceilings and a grand staircase. ""It was a health hazard for the whole community, full of dead birds, rancid water and maggots,"" he says about the abandoned social security office, which he now calls home. In the past few months the number of jobless in Greece has shot up. The current total for young people stands at 51.1%, and Emilio Papas is one of them. He smiles as he admits that the irony of the situation has not escaped him: living in a former social security office when neither he nor any of the other squatters has ever made any national insurance payments. Last year Mr Papas and a group of his unemployed friends, aged between 18 and 32 years old, spent several months making the building habitable. Each of the squatters has his own flat and they are planning on using the ground floor as a community centre for the neighbourhood. They have also opened their doors to an older resident, 60-year-old George Koutselas, who would otherwise have been left homeless. ""I worked most of my life but none of my bosses ever paid national insurance contributions for me, so now I don't get a pension or any benefits. ""As far as the Greek state is concerned I don't exist,"" says Mr Koutselas. Unemployment benefit in Greece is available only to people who have made national insurance contributions and since many young people have never had a job, they are not entitled to any financial support. Even those who do receive the monthly payments of 360 euros (£300) see them stop after one year. After that, unemployed people in Greece are on their own, without access to financial support or free healthcare. Talk of 'revolution' 27-year-old economics graduate Eleni Katsarea is unemployed and worried she might not have a job when her benefit runs out in a few months. ""I am trying not to think about it because I get too stressed,"" she says. The first person in her family to go to university, she never imagined she would end up dependent on the state. But today one in three graduates in Greece is without work and unemployment among postgraduates has doubled. ""I have a degree, I speak several languages and I have something to offer the country but they don't let me, there are no opportunities,"" says Ms Katsarea. When she is not looking for work Eleni Katsarea goes to the centre of town where there are demonstrations almost every day. ""I would like to see a public audit of this debt they are asking us to pay. Who got all the money? Because it wasn't us,"" she shouts over the noise of the protest. The talk among her and her friends is of revolution. Nick Maltoutzis, the deputy editor of the daily English language paper, Kathimerini, says that Greece has reached a dangerous point in terms of youth unemployment. He says too many young people are locked into a situation without prospects, without jobs and without political parties that represent their views. ""There is clearly a lot of anger building up in the system and you cannot predict how the pressure is going to express itself - but you can be sure it will not be pleasant,"" he says. Brain-drain The frustration with the lack of employment opportunities among the young is only exacerbated by the feeling that they have been abandoned by a state which offers them little support. Local unemployment offices are shutting down as a result of cuts in public spending, and those that are open offer little or no advice on how to find a job. The general secretary for the Ministry of Labour, Anna Stratinaki, admits that the ministry is battling to get to grips with plans for the total restructuring of the public sector. ""Young people need to show endurance, courage and solidarity so that we can overcome this difficult period together,"" she says. But endurance, courage and solidarity do not pay the rent and so, for many over-educated and under-employed young people, the future is abroad. Although there are no statistics for the numbers leaving the country, research from 2010 suggests that nearly 85% of Greeks studying abroad were not planning to return. At Athens International Airport 25-year-old Grigoris Panayotopoulos is checking in his baggage as he prepares to fly to Trieste in Italy where he has a job as an engineer lined up. ""Who knows, maybe 10 years from now I might decide to leave behind the job and return to Greece, but at the moment I am planning on going there forever."" It is not his fault, he says, that the Greek economy is in crisis, so why should he pay the price? As he leaves, Grigoris Panayotopoulos takes with him his skills and education. The risk for Greece is that this brain-drain could leave the country without the very people needed to rebuild the economy. 'Scars' of unemployment But for many young people who do not have the means to leave, like Emilios Papas at the squat in the abandoned social security office, they are out on their own. He estimates that at least 70 former government buildings around the city are being used as squats. ""People need to start doing things for themselves because the state only has its own best interests at heart,"" he says. In reality there is little the Greek government can do about the lack of jobs, so long as its hands are tied by the promises it has made to cut the deficit in return for bailout funds. There is evidence to show that people who are unemployed for a long time in their youth have less confidence and tend to achieve less in later life. Experts call this the ""unemployment scar"". So could Greece be storing up a troubled generation for the future? Nick Maltoutzis at the newspaper Kathimerini fears that could be the case. ""People in their 20s… will end up feeling useless and then it's very difficult to change the psychology,"" he says.

Residents and workers were told that an anonymous offer has been made for the airport, but there is no deal as yet. The loss-making airport was bought by Anne Gloag for a £1 in October. On Wednesday, Dutch airline KLM said it was suspending its Cityhopper flights between the airport and Amsterdam from 10 April. A petition to keep the airport open has gained more than 12,000 signatures. Supporters believe it could bring jobs to a deprived area and benefit residents who would otherwise have to travel to Heathrow or Gatwick. A 45-day consultation on the airport closure with its 144 staff is ongoing.

input: In a video posted by Pear Video on the Miaopai video website, the mother and her husband explain they need to raise at least 100,000 yuan (roughly £11,250) for one of their children, who is in an intensive care unit. It's been viewed more than 2.4 million times and has had more than 5,000 comments since it was shared on China's social media platform Sina Weibo. You may also like: The video was filmed in Shenzhen's Children's Park - situated centrally in Shenzhen, a major city in the Guangdong province of China. The mother says she is selling her breast milk to raise money quickly, because one of her twin daughters is in the intensive care unit at the Bao'an District People's Hospital in Shenzhen. Her husband explains that the couple owe the hospital ""hundreds of thousands of yuan"" and ""the doctor said that once she's cured, we should prepare to pay at least 100,000 yuan (roughly £11,250)"". There have been criticisms of Chinese healthcare in recent years as medical centres have been labelled overstretched, and amid claims that people pay extra to jump queues. The reaction online has been mostly sympathetic, with people sharing the phrase ""sell milk, save girl"". Users urged passers-by to ""give money to them"", with some saying they would donate if they saw the parents on the street. And one comment with more than 3,000 likes reads: ""Once people in the lowest level of society become critically ill, they don't even have basic rights."" But some users were less sympathetic, with one person lambasting the decision to sell breast milk as ""a vulgar way of asking for help"". Another added: ""Everybody can understand that you are helpless and hoping to receive aid, but how can you retain your dignity if you have to sell milk?"" But one person criticised the negative comments, saying: ""This is the love of the most helpless parents… those who are saying nasty things online should think that if this was your child, would you care about maintaining face, or your child's life?""

input: By Mark SavageBBC News entertainment reporter ""This is the craziest thing we've ever done,"" Este Haim announces to London's O2 arena. She is at the superdrome to support Florence and the Machine, and her band is about to end their set with a drum solo. Heads down, arms flailing, they unleash a four-minute tsunami of percussion and hair. And the audience, primed for the tribal rhythms of the night's main act, absolutely love it. Half an hour later, the three Haim sisters are back in their dressing room, looking a little less like cavewomen as they demurely sip tea while coming to terms with the fact they have just played on the same stage as the Rolling Stones. ""Don't even talk to me about that, because that is so insane,"" says 26-year-old Este. ""I've been crawling on the floor, trying to soak it all up,"" chips in her youngest sister, Alana, 21. ""I think I have a little Mick Jagger in me."" An argument ensues as the siblings try to decide which of them is ""the most Mick"". It goes back and forth for a couple of minutes until Danielle puts her foot down. ""I feel like both of you would be Mick,"" she tells her sisters. ""And I am in the middle of a Mick sandwich."" In fact, if anyone is the honorary Mick Jagger of Haim, it's 23-year-old Danielle. She earned her rock stripes on tour with Jenny Lewis and Julian Casablancas of The Strokes and has clearly picked up a few tips on poise and attitude. Oh, and she has a lip curl that would put the senior Rolling Stone to shame. The middle sister, and de facto frontwoman, she is also the quietest member of Haim. While her sisters goof around and riff on British television shows (Alana does a frighteningly accurate impression of Dragon's Den star Duncan Bannatyne), Danielle only really comes to life when talking about music. 'No-one cared' Haim started playing together as youngsters, enlisted into a covers band by their estate agent parents. As Rockinhaim, they covered Motown and Santana at street fairs and charity gigs around the San Fernando Valley. ""It was really cool,"" says Alana. ""Until we were about 11."" So in 2006, the girls gave their parents the elbow and ventured out on their own. ""We did what a lot of bands in LA do,"" says Danielle. ""We played around locally, wherever we could play, and we invited all our friends. ""We were scared to ask the main bands for money,"" Este adds. ""We were just so excited to play."" ""By the fourth year, we were having to beg our friends to come. Texting everyone, 'please come and pay $10 for the show.'"" Back then, Haim was not a full-time concern. Alana was at high school, Este studying ""Brazilian carnival music"" at UCLA and Danielle was on the road with Cee-Lo Green. But it was one of her other touring partners, Julian Casablancas, that finally gave the band a kick start. ""He had seen us play and he said, 'what are you guys doing? What's going on?'"" Danielle recalls. ""We didn't know what to do. We had songs on MySpace but no-one really cared. He said, 'just write. Write and come back and hit the ground running.' And that's kind of what we did."" ""We went on Haim-atus,"" laughs Este. Based in their parents' living room, the band took a year to develop their sound - blending the classic guitar chops of Rockinhaim with the staccato hiccups of their favourite bands TLC and Destiny's Child. But, for some reason, they could not get the songs to sound right in the studio. There are ""four EPs"" that will ""never be heard"" in public, admits Alana. ""Whenever we recorded an EP and got it back, we would put it on our stereo and [after] the first five seconds we would cringe and shut it off."" ""In the studio, everything sounds cool,"" explains Danielle. ""But once you put it in your car... We would just throw it away."" Acclaim The missing ingredient turned out to be sub-bass: The lowest frequencies audible to the human ear, used extensively by dance acts to give their rhythm tracks an added wallop. Danielle credits TV composer Ludwig Goransson (New Girl, Community) with the discovery. ""We love rap and we love hip-hop,"" she says. ""Ludwig had all these sub-bass samples and when we found them, we were like, 'oh my God. Put that on everything!'"" ""He looked at us like we were crazy,"" adds Alana. ""But we'd been searching for that for six years."" The first song Haim recorded with Goransson was Forever, which became the title track of their first EP. Released for free in June, it received near-universal acclaim from music blogs and alternative radio stations like BBC 6 Music and Australia's Triple J. Bright, bold and melodic, it is not necessarily a musical revolution - but the combination of Fleetwood Mac folk-rock with the intricate hi-hat trills of '90s R&B is, at least, a fresher take on rock than recycled '60s guitar riffs. That is why Haim were invited on tour by Florence, and by Mumford and Sons. Another stadium-level rock band invited them out on the road this year - but Haim turned them down so they can finish their album. Their family are thrilled by the success. Grandma Haim flew in from Israel to see the O2 gig, while the girls' parents are vicariously living the dream. ""Before we got onstage for the soundcheck, my dad was up there playing drums,"" laughs Este. ""He was like, 'OK they're good, I checked them out for you.' ""And we said, 'oh, come on dad, you just wanted to play drums in the O2 arena. Let's be honest.'""

input: By Mary McCoolBBC Scotland news At age 21 she was a hallmark of British television - a young, smiling dynamo from Edinburgh's Portobello who was perfectly at home leading daytime programmes such as Fully Booked, The Big Breakfast and Live and Kicking before landing a prime time slot hosting Friday night favourite Top of the Pops. Her fan base was burgeoning and she often left the studio in a state of total euphoria. But her seemingly unstoppable energy would deflate as she stepped inside her London flat - where loneliness, self-doubt and depression set in. Then one morning, an event unfolded that left her unable to get out of bed. Gail had taken part in a nude photo shoot for men's magazine FHM, which was projected onto the Houses of Parliament in a now infamous publicity stunt. It helped sell more than one million copies of the magazine within two months. Decades on, Gail maintains she had no idea the photo would be used in such a manner - and that she was never paid for the work. Gail told BBC Scotland: ""I've dealt with things since I was 18 but that knocked my confidence a lot - to think I had trusted someone and then to find my bottom on Big Ben. ""I had to deal with the backlash, some people were kind and some people were unkind. It made me stay in bed for quite a long time."" Revisiting the past The presenter's mental health is the focal point of a new BBC Scotland documentary, which sees her retrace crucial points in her life and career while often hearing difficult truths from friends and family. In the film's opening scenes she revisits the Palace of Westminster and recalls the pressures she faced in the aftermath of the FHM media storm. Criticism and jibes followed her around, occasionally in a very public way - including on an episode of Nevermind the Buzzcocks that same year. Known for his acerbic wit, host Mark Lamarr joked he had seen ""more than enough"" of her topless - a comment which left Gail visibly upset on camera. She said: ""We met up in the green room and I said he was extremely rude - he actually said sorry, that he thought it was a joke. ""Personally it just made me feel insignificant. This was a long time ago when you didn't have the Me Too movement. ""Everyone was going out afterwards; I just wanted to stay home. I thought maybe it's my fault and I deserve this sort of comment."" Despite frequent bouts of unhappiness, keeping up the appearance of 'wee smiley Gail' was of utmost importance - though at the time Gail was unaware of the stress it placed on her mind and body. After moving to London aged 19, there was rarely any food in her fridge - instead she survived on wine or Jelly Babies. She developed anorexia nervosa - a condition she lived with for around nine years. But Gail only realised something was wrong when she was banned from her gym after fainting. ""People kept saying 'oh wow, you're looking great',"" she said. ""I kept thinking every time I get thinner, someone said I looked great. ""I was enjoying the adoration and it got out of control, I couldn't stop it. I thought if I could control my food and make myself look what I thought was better, then everything is going to be great in the world. ""But it wasn't, I just ended up in the hospital very unwell."" I don't blame TV What followed over the next two decades was a further polarising of highs and lows for Gail. She married and celebrated the birth of her ""miracle"" daughter Honey, having been told by doctors she couldn't have children. A severe struggle with her mental health continued, and Gail developed alopecia, turned to self harm, was sectioned under the Mental Health Act (1983) and experienced a period of homelessness. She has no definitive answer for what went wrong for her, though she strongly suspects she developed an aversion to talking through her feelings in her early childhood. And although she has watched her personal life splashed across headlines, Gail does not blame her career in television for any of her struggles. She said: ""Being a TV presenter was my favourite thing in the world, it was the most fun ever. ""I think there were a lot of deeper issues which came out at certain points. ""I know there's something not quite right wired in my brain. ""It doesn't make me a bad person, it doesn't mean you can give me a badge and tell me what it is. I'd rather just be Gail."" Being Gail Porter is available to watch on BBC iPlayer.

input: The Indiana candidate made the remarks while debating his Democratic opponent. He told reporters on Wednesday he ""abhors"" rape and that if anyone ""came away with any impression other than that, I regret it"". Mitt Romney's presidential campaign said he still backed Mr Mourdock, although he disagreed with his views. Mr Mourdock's comments come two months after another Republican candidate caused a furious backlash when he said women's bodies had ways of preventing pregnancy after rape. Mr Romney and President Barack Obama are campaigning hard for the 6 November US presidential election, in which women's votes could prove crucial. 'Humbled' During Tuesday night's debate with his Democratic challenger Joe Donnelly, Mr Mourdock was asked whether he believed abortion should be allowed in cases of rape or incest. ""I struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realise that life is that gift from God,"" he said. ""And, I think, even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen."" At a press conference on Wednesday, Mr Mourdock said he had been ""humbled"" by the reaction to his comments. ""If, because of the lack of clarity in my words, that they came away with an impression other than... life is precious and that I abhor violence and I'm confident that God abhors violence and rape... I truly regret it."" Mr Mourdock, a geologist by trade and the current Indiana state treasurer, said others were trying to ""twist"" his comments. There are 33 Senate seats up for grabs in next month's elections, and the Republicans are hoping to win control of the chamber. The Indiana seat was held safely at the last election by veteran Senator Richard Lugar, but he was ousted by voters in a Republican primary in May. Mr Mourdock is backed by conservative groups, including the Tea Party, and has pledged no compromise with Democrats if he is elected. What polling is available in the state suggests the he and his Democratic rival are in a tight race. Republican backlash Several Republicans in close races, including Mr Romney, have distanced themselves from Mr Mourdock to varying degrees since Tuesday's comments. Romney press secretary Andrea Saul said on Wednesday: ""We disagree on the policy regarding exceptions for rape and incest, but still support him."" The Romney campaign says his administration would not oppose abortion in instances of rape. The National Republican Senatorial Committee also stood by the Senate hopeful. But other Republicans locked in tight election races spoke out against Mr Mourdock, such as Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who also cancelled a planned trip to campaign with him. In Mr Mourdock's home state of Indiana, Representative Mike Pence, running for governor, called on the candidate to apologise. Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown also said he disagreed with Mr Mourdock's views. Democrats pounced on the debate remarks. The Democratic National Committee has released an ad reminding voters of Mr Romney's recent endorsement of Mr Mourdock. Obama campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters that the president found the comment ""outrageous and demeaning to women"". The Obama and Romney campaigns are desperately trying to win women's votes. A gender gap poll among likely voters suggests that Mr Romney enjoys 14% more support among men than Mr Obama, while the president's support among women is 8% more than Mr Romney. In August, Missouri Senate candidate Todd Akin almost derailed his own campaign when he said that in cases of ""legitimate"" rape, ""the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down"" and avert pregnancy. At the time, Mr Romney and other senior Republicans urged Mr Akin to stand aside, but he refused, saying he had misspoken, and asked to be forgiven. Mr Akin lost millions of dollars of funding, but has managed to keep his campaign afloat, polling an average of 5% behind incumbent Clare McCaskill.

input: The minister asked the group to report on the costs and feasibility of implementing changes. An hourly service between Shrewsbury and Aberystwyth could be set up as a result of the findings. The Welsh government said the minister would now consider the recommendations. The Cambrian Rail Implementation Group was formed last November. It followed a report by The Shrewsbury Aberystwyth Railway Liaison Committee which said hourly services could boost employment and tourism. Its report included 6,570 responses by residents, students and businesses in mid Wales, and also called for more trains on the coast line in the summer months. Committee members and other bodies, including Network Rail, Arriva Trains and Aberystwyth University, were then invited to join the new group by Ms Hart. Robert Robinson, joint secretary of the group looking at improvements on the network, said: ""We have submitted the business case which includes a timetable, costings and an implementation plan for the enhanced service to the minister."" He added that the group was due to discuss the report with the minister in March. Hopes for an hourly service along the Cambrian line received a boost last week when Powys planners gave the go-ahead to close five crossings on the network between Carno and Talerddig. The Network Rail project will also include replacing the crossings with two road bridges over the Aberystwyth to Shrewsbury railway line. The planning report said it was part of a plan to introduce an hourly service along the Shrewsbury to Aberystwyth line, and would also allow for the removal of speed restrictions. A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The minister has received the report and will be considering their recommendations before providing a further update to assembly members.""

input: Disability Sport Wales (DSW) performance coach Anthony Hughes was honoured for services to sport at a ceremony at Windsor Castle. Mr Hughes joined DSW in 1999 and helped develop the system that saw Welsh participation in disabled sport rocket. The coach from Penarth called his award ""one of my career highlights"". Mr Hughes took part in shot and javelin events and competed in the 1992 Barcelona Paralympics. He won silver at the 1990 IPC World Championships for the shot and in 1994 held the world record in the event. After retiring from competition due to injury, Mr Hughes moved into coaching, and saw one of his team clinch silver at the Atlanta Paralympics in 1996. In his time at DSW the number of Welsh athletes taking part in the Paralympics has risen from 17 in Sydney 2000 to 38 at London 2012. Two of his proteges - Aled Sion Davies and Josie Pearson - won gold at last summer's Paralympics. 'Richly deserved' Mr Hughes said of his award: ""When I started my job at Disability Sport Wales, I never imagined that one of my career highlights would be receiving an MBE from the Queen. ""Today was such a humbling experience. I am so grateful for all of the support I have received over the years that has enabled me to do my job."" Gareth John, chair of DSW, said of Mr Hughes: ""The MBE that he receives today is so richly deserved having dedicated much of his life to disability and Paralympic sport. ""In a long and distinguished career he has not only excelled as an elite athlete and coach, but he has also been personally responsible for the development of so many talented Paralympians who have gone on to represent Wales and Great Britain with great distinction. ""His contribution to Welsh sport has been hugely significant and it is right and proper that he is being honoured today."" Mr Hughes was named Sport Wales Coach of the Year in 2011 and was inducted into the UK Coaching Hall of Fame in 2012.

input: Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent@BBCRoryCJon Twitter The two counties are the latest to announce how they'll spend their share of the £530m superfast rural broadband fund that the government announced back in 2010. But behind the excitable press release, there's growing dismay about the whole process of delivering fast broadband to rural areas, with the word ""shambles"" making a frequent appearance. People in areas promised a share of the superfast future are growing impatient with the lack of progress. Peter Green, who lives in the community of Eggesford in Devon, is typical. He got in touch to tell me of the frustrations of trying to run a holiday cottage business on a 500Kbps broadband connection - ""We tried to upload videos but it was pointless"" - and his fruitless efforts to find out just when the Connecting Devon and Somerset organisation might take his village into the 21st Century. A contract with BT was signed earlier this year, but he's still no clearer as to when or if that will help him. Here's the charge sheet against the government's efforts: You can see why rural broadband campaigners might be confused about the government's timetable. Back in 2009, the Labour government promised that everyone would get a minimum 2Mbps by 2012. But when the coalition government arrived, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that wasn't good enough. He scrapped the 2012 target, and instead promised that Britain would have the best superfast broadband network in Europe - by 2015. What the market could not deliver - the final third of the country - would be hooked up thanks to that £530m fund from the licence fee, to be administered by a body called BDUK. But, as Mr Green in Devon and many others elsewhere have found, that timetable has now slipped. The process of putting each county's service out to tender has been painfully slow - 16 out of the 41 designated areas have yet to appoint a contractor - and many of the projects won't be completed until 2016. Whose fault is this? BDUK? The councils? BT? They all point the finger at the EU for investigating whether the government cash constituted state aid, but you might ask whether that could not have been foreseen. There also seems to have been far too much complexity in the bidding process. When I contacted Keri Denton, the Devon County Council executive who runs Connecting Devon and Somerset, she insisted that everything was now on schedule since the contract with BT was signed in January. Work on planning the rollout was in full swing, examining every duct, lifting every manhole, to calculate how far the fast network would stretch. I wasn't clear why some of that work could not have begun back in 2010 when the government funding was first announced, but she insisted that wasn't possible while the procurement process was ongoing. ""We would share that frustration,"" she said when I told her how painful it all looked to those waiting for the network. But she maintained that the end result would be a ""damned good deal"" for the councils, and for residents. BT, not surprisingly, agrees with that. The company insists that Britain is still on track to hit that 2015 target of the best superfast broadband in Europe - even if many of the rural projects won't be complete by then. Bill Murphy, the man running the operation, says there were other firms competing for some of the contracts in the early stages but ""they all found it very difficult to make a case"". When I put it to him that it might have been better and faster to have central government just hand the whole thing to BT from the start, with tight regulation, he disagreed. ""It is a long process, it does cost money to procure things locally, but the fact of the matter is that the only way you're going to get local buy-in is to do it locally."" It is the Department of Culture, Media and Sport which is getting most of the blame. It always looked strange that a department with little experience in this field should be in charge of such a major infrastructure project. Now it seems the Treasury agrees - a report on government infrastructure projects by the Commercial Secretary Lord Deighton is thought to be critical of BDUK, recommending a shake-up. Even Maria Miller, the current Culture Secretary, seems keen to distance herself from the work of her predecessor in this area. I understand that she feels now is the time, as the procurement process nears its conclusion, to bring in some more commercial expertise to BDUK, rather than leaving the civil servants in charge. In the meantime, Mr Green is still waiting to hear when his village will move out of the slow lane. ""We've been waiting years to get anything more than 500k and there's a total lack of information."" He points out that council taxpayers are also contributing to the scheme to the tune of more than £20m. ""It's a lot of money locally and we should be seeing something from it. We hear that broadband speeds are going up nationally but that's in the towns. In the rural areas we are stuck where we are."" Later this week there should be more news, both nationally and locally, on the progress of the superfast broadband project. But that ambition of showing the rest of Europe how to do it by 2015 now looks more challenging than ever.

input: By Helen BriggsEnvironment Correspondent, BBC News Fragments of wheat DNA recovered from an ancient peat bog suggests the grain was traded or exchanged long before it was grown by the first British farmers. The research, published in Science, suggests there was a sophisticated network of cultural links across Europe. The grain was found at what is now a submerged cliff off the Isle of Wight. Farming of plants and animals first appeared in the Near East, with the technology spreading along two main routes into Europe. The accepted date of arrival on the British mainland is around 6,000 years ago, as ancient hunter gatherers began to grow crops such as wheat and barley. The DNA of the wheat - known as einkorn - was collected from sediment that was once a peat bog next to a river. Scientists think traders arrived in Britain with the wheat, perhaps via land bridges that connected the south east coast of Britain to the European mainland, where they encountered a less advanced hunter gatherer society. The wheat may have been made into flour to supplement the diet, but a search for pollen and other clues revealed no signs that the crop was grown in Britain until much later. Cultural connection Dr Robin Allaby of the University of Warwick, who led the research, said 8,000 years ago the people of mainland Britain were leading a hunter-gatherer existence, while at the same time farming was gradually spreading across Europe. ""Common throughout neolithic Southern Europe, einkorn is not found elsewhere in Britain until 2,000 years after the samples found at Bouldnor Cliff,"" he said. ""For the einkorn to have reached this site there needs to have been contact between mesolithic [the culture between paleolithic and neolithic] Britons and neolithic farmers far across Europe. ""The land bridges provide a plausible facilitation of this contact. As such, far from being insular, mesolithic Britain was culturally and possibly physically connected to Europe."" The research shows that scientists can analyse genetic material preserved within the sediments of the landscapes stretching between Britain and Europe in prehistoric times. Co-researcher Prof Vincent Gaffney, of the University of Bradford, said the find marked a new chapter in British and European history. ""It now seems likely that the hunter-gather societies of Britain, far from being isolated were part of extensive social networks that traded or exchanged exotic foodstuffs across much of Europe,"" he said. Tangible link And Garry Momber of the Maritime Archaeology Trust, which collected the samples from the site, said work in the Solent had opened up an understanding of the UK's formative years in a way that he never dreamed possible. ""The material remains left behind by the people that occupied Britain as it was finally becoming an island 8,000 years ago, show that these were sophisticated people with technologies thousands of years more advanced than previously recognised. ""The DNA evidence corroborates the archaeological evidence and demonstrates a tangible link with the continent that appears to have become severed when Britain became an island.""

input: The budget for the National Assembly for Wales is increasing by 5.6% to £56.7m next year - above inflation and despite Welsh Government funding only rising by 1.1%. The finance committee said future increases should be reined in. The assembly commission, which is led by senior AMs, said it would respond to the report in due course. In a report, the finance committee said that ""at a time when many other public services in Wales are facing extensive and continuing real terms cuts, it is hard to justify any increase in the assembly's spending"". In the remaining years of the assembly term, which ends in 2021, the report said the commission's budget ""should not be in excess of any changes to the Welsh block grant"". The assembly has ring-fenced £700,000 next year to prepare the way for a new assembly building. But AMs on the cross-party committee said the evidence presented to support this proposal was ""weak"". Despite the desire for a new building, £1.9m was spent on refurbishing the ground floor of Ty Hywel. ""The committee questions why a short-term, less expensive solution was not implemented, prior to a new building potentially being built, which could have accommodated additional committee rooms,"" the report said. AMs also called for staff numbers to stay static in 2018-19. Numbers of staff increased from 446 posts budgeted for in 2017-18, to 452 who are currently employed by the assembly. ""A functioning legislature is essential for a healthy democracy, but we are not immune to the austerity being felt by so many public sector organisations, including our hospitals and schools,"" said Simon Thomas, the committee's chairman.

The US President then rowed back on his initial comments following criticism from a number of MPs.

input: Chief Constable Sue Sim said the force had offered support ""far in excess of any legal duty"" to David Rathband. At an inquest in Newcastle, coroner Eric Armstrong found Mr Rathband, who was shot by Raoul Moat in 2010, took his own life in February 2012. The 44-year-old's family said they would ""continue with David's litigation"" against the force. PC David Rathband was found hanged in Blyth, in Northumberland, in February 2012, 19 months after being shot as he sat in his patrol car. The inquest had heard he had threatened to kill himself after being injured. Mr Armstrong said he was ""drawn inescapably to the conclusion that David intended to take his own life"" and that he did not believe Mr Rathband's actions were a ""cry for help"" because he had locked his door, leaving the key in the lock. He told the inquest that Mr Rathband's colleagues and friends may, ""with the benefit of hindsight, form the view that they wish they could have done something else"". However, he said such things should not be dwelled on as they had taken decisions ""which at the time seemed appropriate and were justified"". 'Totally without justification' Mr Rathband had been pursuing legal action against Northumbria Police claiming he should not have been in a patrol car alone when a gunman was on the rampage. After the hearing, Ms Sim said the coroner had been ""satisfied that David took his own life"" and ""did not criticise any individual or organisation"". ""I gave David my personal commitment that, should he wish to do so, he could return to Northumbria Police as a police officer,"" she said. ""There have been criticisms levelled at Northumbria Police during the inquest by some of David's family. ""We fully understand the family's grief at David's death but we must refute any suggestion that we failed to support David or that the support we provided was inadequate. ""Such allegations are totally without justification. We provided the highest level of financial, welfare and rehabilitation support to David, far in excess of any legal duty."" Outside the inquest, Mr Rathband's sister Debbie Essery said he had ""suffered horrific, life-changing injuries which he fought bravely and with courage and dignity, trying to come to terms with a life of pain and darkness"". ""The loss of David has devastated our family. We will never be able to come to terms with this."" She added that the family would ""now continue with David's litigation against Northumbria Police for the benefit of David's children"". 'Incredibly inspirational' Mrs Rathband's estranged wife Kath, who had told the three-day inquest their marriage ended after her husband's affair with 7/7 London bomber survivor Lisa French, asked for privacy. In a statement read by lawyer Philip Davison, she said the attack by Moat had changed her family's lives ""irrevocably"". ""David fought so hard to come to terms with the devastating injuries and the effect it had on us all as a family. ""Whilst I have lost David, he has left me with two amazing children and he would be immensely proud of them and what they have achieved, as I am."" Following the shooting, Mr Rathband set up the Blue Lamp Foundation, which supports emergency services workers injured in the line of duty, and has so far raised more than £400,000. Sharon Ashurst, from the charity, described him as ""incredibly inspirational"" and ""fun to be around"". Related Internet Links HM Court Service

The move rejects a recommendation by public health experts to impose the strictest level five measures. Mr Martin said moving to level five could have ""severe implications"". ""If we all act now we can stop the need to go further, with introducing level four and five restrictions,"" he continued. The taoiseach said this would risk hundreds of thousands of jobs. The challenge for government ""at this stage"", he added, was to be as ""effective and proportionate as possible"" in how it deals with Covid-19. No crowds at sport The Irish government's decision rejects the recommendation by National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) to move to level five. This would have seen restrictions similar to the lockdown measures imposed in March. But Tánaiste (Deputy PM) Leo Varadkar told RTÉ the government did not think the NPHET recommendation had been ""thought through properly"". Level three measures mean there will now be tighter limitations on gatherings and people will be advised to work from home unless absolutely necessary. It also means that sporting fixtures in the Republic of Ireland will be played behind closed doors, with only professional or elite sporting activities permitted. Mr Martin said the country's five-level system allowed the government to have a flexible and appropriate response to ""new trends"". However, he said it also gives ""everybody a fair opportunity to plan and respond"". In response to Mr Martin's statement, Sinn Féin president Mary-Lou McDonald questioned what additional support would be provided for families, workers and businesses affected by the new regulations. The taoiseach reported that the new restrictions would be reviewed in three weeks' time. Counties Donegal and Dublin had already been placed under level three restrictions in recent weeks. There were 518 new cases in the country on Monday, with no further deaths in the previous 24 hours. Level three restrictions involve: The letter sent to the government by the NPHET on Sunday calling for a move to level five restrictions nationwide was published on Monday evening. It states that ""it is vital we do everything in our power now to arrest the current trajectory nationally and very substantially suppress the virus back down to a low level of transmission in advance of the winter months."" It adds: ""The NPHET advises that the profile of the disease is such that a graduated approach will not have sufficient or timely impact on the trajectory and scale of the disease and will not protect the core priorities set out above. ""A graduated approach would, ultimately, result in application of level five measures as mitigation. ""In contrast, the immediate application of level five is intended to limit the impact of public health of Covid-19"".

The agency urged drivers to seek alternative routes via the M3 or M40. Diversions have been put in place along the A312 and the A4, and the A40 is expected to be congested as well. London-bound traffic will be able to join the M4 at junction 2 and traffic heading out of London can stay on until junction 2, although there is a lane two closure in this direction. The Highways Agency said it expects all work on the M4 to be finished before the start of the Olympic Games later this month. The full closure of the motorway in both directions between Chiswick and Feltham began at 20:00 BST on Friday. 'Sensitive location' Restrictions on vehicles weighing more than 7.5 tonnes had been in place since March when hairline cracks were discovered in some of the steel beams. The agency said on Friday workers ""found a further crack in a sensitive location which requires us to keep the viaduct closed until the repair is complete"". Jon Caldwell from the Highways Agency warned there would be delays. ""The repair works that we need to do, to bolt the plates to the decking, needs to be done with no traffic on it,"" Mr Caldwell told the BBC. ""We need to do it now so that it's all completed ready for when the Olympic traffic starts to use the road in a few weeks' time."" The M4 is the main route between Heathrow Airport and central London and will be vital for transporting visitors into the city for the Games. It is also the major road link from London to the West Country and Wales, as well as being a heavily-used commuter route. London Mayor Boris Johnson said it was vital the repairs were completed ""as speedily as possible"".

input: By Jonathan HeadSouth East Asia correspondent A year later, Rajabhakti Park has become a millstone around the neck of the military government, and a symbol of how their efforts to promote the monarchy - at an awkward moment as Thailand faces its first royal succession in nearly 70 years - can go wrong. The project has been tarnished by allegations of corruption - a scourge General Prayuth promised to tackle when he seized power last year. Other government-backed ventures intended to showcase support for the monarchy have been similarly tainted. Not just by allegations of mismanaged funds, but also by the mysterious deaths in custody, or disappearances, of people who had been close to Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn. The monarchy is an acutely sensitive topic in Thailand, made all the more delicate by the severity of the lese majeste law which inhibits any public debate about the institution. The officially-sanctioned view of the monarchy is that it is loved and respected by all Thais, who support the law. In fact, there are Thais who take a different view, but who do not dare to express it publicly. From the moment it seized power last year, the military made protecting the monarchy from any kind of critical scrutiny a top priority. It ordered the police to be more rigorous in prosecuting anyone caught saying anything negative about the royal family. It insisted defendants be tried in military courts, and sometimes in secret. Around 100 people have been charged with lese majeste since the coup, and sentences have become harsher, with one young mother-of-two being given a 28-year sentence in August. At the same time, the military set about trying to burnish the public image of Prince Vajiralongkorn, in preparation for him to succeed the ailing King Bhumibol. The lese majeste law makes it impossible for anyone in Thailand to speak frankly about members of the royal family. The commonly-used way to describe the comparison between the heir and the King is that ""he does not enjoy the same popularity as his father."" In August, the government organised a mass bicycle ride in Bangkok, led by the Crown Prince and his eldest daughter, in honour of Queen Sirikit, who is also in poor health. It was the first time Thais had seen the 63-year-old prince in a relatively informal setting, smiling and looking trim in his cycling clothes. The event was deemed a success, and the government held another one on Friday to commemorate the King's birthday. Then in October three men were suddenly arrested and charged with lese majeste. One, a famous fortune-teller and television personality known as Mor Yong, had played a prominent role in organising the first Bike for Mom event. He and his two co-defendants, one of them an influential police officer responsible for countering anti-monarchy sentiment on the internet, were accused of abusing the Crown Prince's name to raise funds illicitly with products like t-shirts and badges linked to the bike rides. Mor Yong had posted photos of himself with prominent public figures on his Facebook page, as part of his promotional activities. Four days later, the government announced that the police major had hanged himself with his shirt in his cell. Two weeks after that, they announced that Mor Yong too had died in custody, from blood poisoning. There was no proper autopsy and both men's bodies were hurriedly cremated. At the same time the personal bodyguard of the Crown Prince disappeared. He has since been stripped of all his titles and accused of ""gravely evil acts"" against the monarchy. It is widely believed that he is dead. Two other senior military officers have also disappeared, and have since been charged with lese majeste. They have also been linked to alleged abuses in the funding of Rajabhakti Park, which was formally opened by the Crown Prince and his daughter in September. The government and the army have tried, and failed, to stem the tide of allegations surrounding the park. General Udomdej Sitabutr, who was army commander until October this year and oversaw the project, admitted that irregular commissions were demanded by middlemen for the foundries building the huge statues, which cost around $1 million each. But he said he had insisted the commissions were refunded, although he explained the foundries then donated those commissions to an army charity. There have been allegations of inflated prices paid for trees planted in the park too. And an initial denial that any government funds were used to build the park turned out to be untrue - around $2 million came from state coffers. The army announced its own investigation, and quickly concluded there was no corruption. There was a public outcry, so the Ministry of Defence has ordered another investigation. The police say they cannot investigate unless the military authorises them to do so. A government spokesman told the BBC that independent agencies would soon be allowed to scrutinise the accounts of the project, but could not say when. The government's opponents have jumped on the opportunity to illustrate what they say is hypocrisy on the part of the military in prosecuting former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra for alleged corruption under her administration, yet failing to clean up its own house. Student activists and leaders of the pro-Yingluck ""red shirt"" movement have tried to organise visits to the park, but have been stopped and detained by the army. The government has also charged some of those spreading negative information about the park with sedition, a serious offence which carries a penalty of up to seven years in prison. Few people outside the top ranks of the military can know what lies behind these disturbing developments. But they show that the men who seized power last year, despite their considerable power, have nevertheless been unable to prevent damaging allegations of wrongdoing being made about their own royal promotion projects. Nor have they been able yet to provide a convincing response to those allegations. Many people in Thailand believe the revelations indicate divisions at the top over how to handle the royal succession, and crucially, who has control over this historic transition.

input: By Steven McIntoshEntertainment reporter But that's about to change with the launch of Animals With Cameras - BBC One's latest nature documentary, which begins on Thursday. For the three-part series, cameras were strapped to animals so scientists (and viewers) could monitor where they go and what they do. And the results are fascinating. ""The technology is finally there to do it,"" series producer Dan Rees tells BBC News. ""Batteries are small enough. Lenses are small enough. You can get small enough sensors to give you a high definition image which can produce slow motion video. ""You can get [the cameras] onto an animal at the size it's comfortable for the animal to wear, that won't affect their behaviour."" Rees says the main benefit of such equipment is that it lets audiences into territory they won't have seen before. ""We can't go down into burrows, high into the air, deep under the sea - so it's a lot to do with access,"" he says. BBC producers offered to share technology and footage with scientists who were already studying a particular species. In most cases, the cameras were fitted by scientists who were already used to handling those animals. But a few animals had to be sedated in order to attach the cameras. ""Animal welfare was extremely important for us,"" Rees says. ""The last thing we want to do is cause them distress. To follow an animal in the first place, there had to be a clear benefit in terms of knowledge about it that might be useful to protecting a species in the future. ""The scientists had to be comfortable that disruption was kept to a minimum."" Last year, Tom McDonald, head of commissioning at the BBC's Natural History unit, singled out the meerkats as one of the series highlights, joking: ""That's my innovation for 2018, more meerkats."" They are, indeed, the focus of the first episode. ""They're just enduringly popular,"" laughs Rees. ""Those car insurance adverts proved to be great PR for meerkats. ""They're a film-maker's dream, because they've got so much personality. They're photogenic, and they spend a lot of time vertical, standing up, which makes quite a big difference - they just feel very human as a consequence."" Presumably, one issue while shooting a programme like this is the potential for expensive equipment to be damaged by the animals on their travels. ""Yes, that was a risk,"" Rees admits. ""And some cameras we didn't get back. ""Things like the meerkats, cheetahs and chimps, the habituated animals, the scientists are interacting with them every day so you know the cameras are going to come back."" Habituated species are generally used to human presence and have normally already been monitored in a fixed territory for some time. ""Having said that, at least one of the meerkat cameras fell off in the burrow, so it'll just stay down there, which won't cause any problems or anything, but sadly there's no way of recovering that footage - the cameras are too small to fit in a transmitter,"" Rees says. ""So with habituated animals it's not really a problem, but with totally wild ones, it is. We fortunately didn't lose any of the underwater ones, which is remarkable really. The penguins and seals come back ashore, so as long as the camera stays on, you can get it back."" In recent weeks we've seen nature documentaries influence public opinion on certain issues, and in some cases even government policy - with one episode of Blue Planet II drawing attention to the detrimental impact of plastic waste on the environment. Speaking to Andrew Marr last month about the success of the plastic bag charge, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""Nobody who watched Blue Planet will doubt the need for us to do something [about plastic waste]."" Rees's hope is that Animals With Cameras will further raise the audience's awareness of the world around them. ""We [producers] are in the business in the first place because we love animals,"" he says. ""And one of the things we hope will come out of these documentaries is we'll inspire people to care about nature on a broad level. ""I just hope it opens people's eyes to how amazing these animals are, and also perhaps makes people aware of how much we still have to learn about even some really popular animals. They still have a lot of mysteries about them."" 3 highlights to watch out for in Animals With Cameras Animals With Cameras begins on BBC One at 20:00 GMT on Thursday, 1 February.

Mr Davies said he was not convinced the Welsh Government would ""have a leg to stand on"" in trying to shape international trade deals after Brexit. Following Donald Trump's comments during last week's trade visit that the NHS would be ""on the table"" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was ""absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation.""

input: Twitter's shares shot up 11.6% in the first hours of trading, but have dropped to just a 5% increase. The jump came after a report that tech investor Marc Andreessen and investment firm Silver Lake Partners were considering a deal with Twitter. Hours later, Fortune reported Silver Lake was not interested in any deal. ""Silver Lake has no interest in acquiring even a slice of Twitter,"" the Fortune report said. Neither story reported any details of the potential deal or the names of the sources, but the speculation was enough to send Twitter's share price bouncing. The social media site has been struggling to boost its profits. The company is looking to appoint two new board members and a new chief marketing officer ahead of its quarterly profit report on 10 February. Shares of Twitter are down more than 60% from their April highs. Twitter has struggled to attract new users, leading investors to question whether it has the staying power and growth potential of rival social media sites.

input: Shadow Welsh Secretary Owen Smith said such an alliance would be ""difficult"". However, earlier former Welsh Secretary Peter Hain suggested Labour could form a coalition if it fails to win an majority at the next general election. Mr Smith, speaking at the Labour conference, said his party was ""gunning to try and win"" a majority. Writing in the Independent on Sunday, Neath MP Mr Hain suggested majority single-party governments may become the exception in a future where coalitions are semi-permanent fixtures. The Liberal Democrats went into coalition with the Conservatives after the 2010 general election when no party won an outright majority. Mr Hain argued that Lib Dem members might reject the leadership who ""hijacked their party and took it into bed with the Tories,"" including Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg. ""A new Lib Dem leadership more in tune with the party's traditions will make it much easier for Ed Miliband to strike a deal - assuming, of course, that there are sufficient Lib Dem MPs remaining after a probable battering,"" he wrote. ""In that context, Ed Miliband's vision of Labour holds great attractions for those anxious to establish a government for the progressive, anti-Tory majority that was often denied office in the last century."" He told BBC Radio Wales Labour was ""well-placed to be the biggest party at the next general election"". Mr Hain added: ""Whether we can actually win after a bad defeat last time - win outright - remains to be seen. ""I think it's quite possible, but that depends on the next couple of years of government."" 'Truly awful defeat' Responding to his predecessor's comments at the start of the Labour conference, Mr Smith said: ""It will be difficult, we know that. ""We know that we had the worst defeat since 1918. ""It was a truly awful defeat for Labour and we know that we've got to work very hard to win back peoples' trust in order to give us a chance of winning the next election. ""We're definitely the underdogs in this fight right now but we're doing better than we were last year, we're doing better certainly than we were two years ago and I don't think we really need to start thinking right now - interesting a parlour game though it is - about whether we go into coalition with the Lib Dems or anyone else."" He said a coalition with the Lib Dems would be ""difficult, truthfully, because I think we feel that the Lib Dems have propped up a very right-wing Conservative government"".

input: The prince, whose four-month deployment to the country has just ended, spoke about his role as an Apache co-pilot gunner, and whether he had killed. ""Yeah, so lots of people have. The squadron's been out here. Everyone's fired a certain amount,"" he said. ""If there's people trying to do bad stuff to our guys, then we'll take them out of the game."" Prince Harry left Afghanistan on Monday. News teams were allowed to interview him during his deployment, if they agreed to delay broadcast until he had left the country. As well as discussing his role in Afghanistan, he talked about various other issues, including that he had ""let my family down"" when he was pictured naked in a Las Vegas hotel room last year. He said this was ""probably a classic example of me probably being too much Army and not enough prince."" But he added: ""But at the end of the day I was in a private area and there should have been a certain amount of privacy that one should expect."" He also talked about: On his role in Afghanistan, one journalist said: ""You are the man with the trigger in your hand, and if called upon, you will fire, and presumably you have and you will kill the enemy?"" The prince responded: ""Yeah, so lots of people have. The squadron's been out here. Everyone's fired a certain amount. Probably a little bit more than this time last year, to a certain extent, but that's just the way that its balanced out. Mainly due to weather, well whatever the reasons, I don't know. ""We fire when we have to, take a life to save a life, but essentially we're more of a deterrent than anything else."" He said missions to recover injured troops were a key role. ""Our job out here is to make sure the guys are safe on the ground. ""Now if that means shooting at someone who's shooting at them, then we'll do it."" 'Stuck in Bastion' Prince Harry is the first member of the Royal Family to see active combat since his uncle, the Duke of York, fought in the Falklands War. Captain Wales, as the prince is known in the military, arrived for his second tour as part of the 100-strong 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment, Army Air Corps in September. Within days of arriving, Camp Bastion was attacked by Taliban insurgents. Prince Harry was moved under guard to a secure location during the attack. Prince Harry said: ""Obviously the papers back home were like 'this is all against me'. No-one really knows yet. But either way, this camp is in the middle of Afghanistan and it should be expected to be attacked at any point... and it was on my birthday, so it was a bit of a reality check."" His first tour was cut short in 2008 after 10 weeks because a media blackout was broken. He was removed from Afghanistan in case he became a target. Then he was part of ground forces, calling in air strikes against enemy positions. He was disappointed to be withdrawn, and determined to return to front-line combat. He said: ""My choice would have been back out on the ground with my regiment - that sounds quite spoilt when I'm standing in front of this [helicopter], £45 million worth, but hopefully my friends and family back home know exactly what I'm talking about."" Brotherly support He expressed support for his older brother, William, to serve in combat. William currently flies search and rescue missions from RAF Valley on Anglesey. ""Obviously he'd love to be out here and I don't see why to be honest with you, I don't see why he couldn't.... no-one knows he's in the cockpit."" He added: ""Yes, he'd get shot at but, you know, if the guys who are doing the same job as us are being shot at on the ground, I don't think there's anything wrong with us being shot at as well. ""People back home have issues with that, but we're not special - the guys out there are. Simple as that."" He also described how he juggled his different roles in life. ""You've got to be able to flick the switch all the time. ""I think I said a while back there's three 'me's, as it were. One in the army, one socially - my own private time - and one sort of with the family and stuff like that. ""So, you know, there is a switch and I flick it when necessary. And I like to think it's measured and balanced... Army comes first - it is my work at the end of the day.""

input: It is thought to be the first large-scale attack on Apple's App Store. The hackers created a counterfeit version of Apple's software for building iOS apps, which they persuaded developers to download. Apps compiled using the tool allow the attackers to steal data about users and send it to servers they control. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks - which has analysed the malware dubbed XcodeGhost - said the perpetrators would also be able to send fake alerts to infected devices to trick their owners into revealing information. It added they could also read and alter information in compromised devices' clipboards, which would potentially allow them to see logins copied to and from password management tools. Infected applications includes Tencent's hugely popular WeChat app, NetEase's music downloading app and Didi Kuaidi's Uber-like car hailing app. Some of the affected apps - including the business card scanner CamCard - are also available outside China. ""We've removed the apps from the App Store that we know have been created with this counterfeit software,"" said Apple spokeswoman Christine Monaghan. ""We are working with the developers to make sure they're using the proper version of Xcode to rebuild their apps,"" said Christine Monaghan. On its official WeChat blog, Tencent said the security issue affected an older version of its app - WeChat 6.2.5 - and that newer versions were not affected. It added that an initial investigation showed that no data theft or leakage of user information had occurred. Analysis: Dave Lee, North America technology reporter In Apple's walled garden App Store, this sort of thing shouldn't happen. The company goes to great lengths, and great expense, to sift through each and every submission to the store. Staff check for quality, usability and, above all else, security. The Apple App Store is generally considered a safe haven as the barrier to entry is high - there's only been a handful of instances of malware found on iOS apps, compared to Google's Play store which for a while was regarded as something of a ""Wild West"" for apps (until they introduced their own malware-scanning system too). It makes this attack all the more surprising, as it looks like two groups of supposedly informed people have been caught out. Firstly developers, who security researchers say were duped into using counterfeit software to build their apps, creating the right conditions for the malware to be applied. And secondly, Apple's quality testers, who generally do a very good job in keeping out nasties, but in this case couldn't detect the threat. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Developers targeted The malware was initially flagged by researchers at the Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba. It discovered that the hackers had uploaded several altered versions of Xcode - a tool used to build iOS apps - to a Chinese cloud storage service. Then, about six months ago, the attackers posted links to the software on several forums commonly visited by Chinese developers. ""In China - and in other places around the world - sometimes network speeds are very slow when downloading large files from Apple's servers,"" explained Palo Alto Networks in a follow-up blog. ""As the standard Xcode installer is nearly three gigabytes, some Chinese developers choose to download the package from other sources."" It added that potentially hundreds of millions of users might have been affected. Apple does have a security tool - called Gatekeeper - that is designed to alert users to unauthorised Mac programs and stop them from being run. However, it appears the developers must disabled the facility, allowing them to create iOS apps with XcodeGhost. Sense of security Despite the many news headlines about the breach, one expert said he did not forecast a major impact on the sale of Apple products. ""It is definitely embarrassing for Apple but the reality is that malware is a persistent problem since the days of PCs and the problem will multiply as the number of mobile devices explodes from 1.4 billion units in 2015 to 1.8 billion in 2020,"" Wee Teck Loo, head of consumer electronics at market research firm Euromonitor International, told the BBC. In fact, consumers are less cautious on mobile devices than on PCs, he added. ""In emerging markets like China or Vietnam, mobile devices are their first connected product and security is taken for granted,"" he said. ""Consumers in emerging markets are also less protective of privacy and security issues."" Earlier this month, login names and passwords for more than 225,000 Apple accounts were stolen by cyber-thieves in China. It was uncovered by security firm Palo Alto Networks while investigating suspicious activity on many Apple devices. It found a malicious software family that targets jailbroken iPhones. The majority of people affected were in China.

input: By Mark DevenportBBC News NI Political Editor The Loyalist Communities Council (LCC) was launched in 2015. In a statement, it said that ""any unionist who votes for the Alliance Party is driving a nail into the coffin of the union"". The Alliance Party has strongly rebuked the LCC position, calling the statement ""absurd"". The loyalist community council has the backing of the Ulster Defence Association, the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Red Hand Commando. The LCC also said no party has done ""more to undermine the Britishness of Northern Ireland, and foment community mistrust and division than the Alliance Party"". It called for a maximum turnout by unionist voters and endorsed four specific candidates. They are Ulster Unionist Tom Elliott in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, the DUP's Nigel Dodds in North Belfast, the DUP's Gavin Robinson in East Belfast and the DUP's Emma Little Pengelly in South Belfast. In the first two constituencies, the candidates mentioned are the only unionists running, but in the other two seats the DUP faces competition from the Ulster Unionists. Alliance 'satisfied' In a statement, the Alliance Party said: ""In sharp contrast to the DUP, who appear content to accept the endorsement of paramilitaries, Alliance is satisfied to accept their rejection of our principled and consistent stand for the rule of law and against all terrorism. ""This absurd statement shows not only the dearth of political analysis within loyalist paramilitaries at this time, but highlights clearly which parties are really willing to take on and challenge paramilitaries, and which are happier to chase and foster their support."" In Monday night's UTV election debate, both Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill and Alliance's Naomi Long challenged the DUP's Nigel Dodds to reject the endorsement of a group linked to loyalist paramilitaries. Mr Dodds replied that his party had always opposed paramilitarism. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme on Tuesday, the DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said: ""I do not seek, nor does the DUP seek the support or endorsement of any paramilitary organisation, and we reject any such endorsement."" The Ulster Unionist Party leader, Robin Swann, said: ""The Ulster Unionist Party is a party of law and order. ""We have not asked for the support of paramilitary organisations nor do we want the backing of organisations still engaged in paramilitary or criminal activity."" On social media, former Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt has clarified that he has not asked for and does not accept the LCC's statement of support. Mr Nesbitt was not one of the candidates mentioned in the group's election statement. Tony Blair's former chief of staff Jonathan Powell played a part in setting up the LCC. Mr Powell described the formation of the council as the ""last best chance"" to include loyalists left behind by the peace process.

input: By Graham FraserBBC Scotland These women come together on the first Monday of every month for the Feel Good Project, an award-winning community initiative at the Lady J's Unisex Hair Salon. Lady J is Jill Lauder. Her salon is adorned with pictures of Elvis Presley, her favourite star, and among all the products you would expect to find in a hairdressing salon is a silver engraved plate. It was awarded to Jill by CVS Falkirk when they named her as their volunteer of the year. At the back of the salon, in an area usually reserved for the washing and drying of hair, an urn of tea has been set up for the day next to some cakes, biscuits and three large boxes of wigs. ""I started the project because I had lost two good friends at one time,"" said Jill. ""I used to do their wigs, and pamper them. Once they were gone, I felt I had nothing to do."" Jill spoke with one her customers, Sandra Campbell. Sandra is the nurse consultant for cancer and palliative care with NHS Forth Valley, and Jill came up with the idea for the Feel Good Project at her salon after speaking with her. The Macmillan one to one team from NHS Forth Valley provide support to Jill's project. This team supports people with cancer and works with many other groups both inside and outside of the NHS. Sandra is in the salon this Monday, chatting with various women and offering advice. ""The people within the NHS do the very best they can, but what we need is to be able to work with partners as well,"" she said. ""We need to all work together and that is all charities, big, small, and projects like this. ""It is the supportive atmosphere you feel in here which is really good. ""What the team here do is all from kindness - they give up their time, and the premises. Not everyone is able to do that. But if people are willing and able to partner up with someone within the NHS for that bit of support then it is a fantastic way to go."" The Cancer Journey Sharon McFeat, 47, has been coming along to the Feel Good project for four years after seeing a post about the initiative on social media. She was diagnosed four years ago with a sarcoma cancer in her leg. Two years ago, it spread to other parts of her body. She is now fundraising for another type of treatment not available on the NHS. ""Somewhere like here has been really supportive, because it is not a hospital environment for once, and you can just speak to other people who may not have the same cancer as you, but are going through similar types and totally understand how you feel. ""There have been people who used to come here who are not here anymore, who we became close to. That is just part and parcel of the cancer journey."" Everyone working in the salon on the Feel Good Project is a volunteer. Jill provides and fits wigs and cuts hair, while Jayne applies nail polish and gives hand massages. Mo, who works as a make-up consultant with Boots, helps the women with their make-up and eyebrows. Other volunteers make soup, cakes, and bring tablet along for everyone to enjoy. Everything is free. Sixty-year-old Karen MacLennan, from Grangemouth, is another woman who is benefitting from the salon. She has known Jill for years, and started coming to the cancer project after discovering a lump on her breast almost three years ago. Karen has been in surgery three times, and has had chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She will take drugs for the next decade as part of her treatment. ""It's fabulous, because we all get together and we are all in the same position with cancer. Many different kinds of cancer, and different places. ""It is a great social time, and we can be very practical talking about side effects. ""The girls - Jill, and all her volunteers are fantastic. You can relax, and have a laugh, and enjoy your afternoon."" This project is clearly having a positive impact on the lives of women with cancer in Grangemouth, but Jill sees no reason why projects like this can't be started in communities across the UK and beyond. She added: ""Nearly every salon is shut on a Monday. Wouldn't it be lovely if we could just open one up for a few hours, and we had one every week? ""It is really easy to set up, it is fantastic to do and you are helping in your community.""

""They surround us now, they're on the Brittany coast, they're on the Normandy coast - we will get them"", he said. A nest of Asian Hornets found in Alderney in July was destroyed as a precaution against them spreading, the Alderney government said. In Jersey, an amateur insect expert who photographed it at Mount Bingham, Jersey's environment department said. The department said the area had been searched and no further hornet activity detected. Dismember bees People who suspect they have found a hornet should send a photograph to the department if it is safe to do so, a spokesman said. Mr Hogge said the Asian Hornet dismembered honey bees to take back to feed their young and could wipe out entire hives. ""They've got a particularly unpleasant sting, and they are aggressive. If one attacks you and leaves a sting it will leave a scent and others will come and attack you too,"" he added. However, the department stressed the Asian hornet was no more harmful to humans than the European hornet. Identifying an Asian hornet Source: National Bee Unit

input: Catholics were encouraged to go to designated points along the country's borders for a mass rosary prayer for the salvation of Poland and the world. Church leaders say the event is purely religious, but there are concerns it could be seen as endorsing the state's refusal to let in Muslim migrants. The feast day marks the anniversary of a Christian victory over Ottoman Turks at the sea battle of Lepanto in 1571. People were bussed in from more than 300 churches to points all along the border. They stood in lines, some on beaches on the Baltic Sea, some in fields and some in towns. ""We come to the border of Poland to pray for the Poles and for the whole world,"" said one woman. ""We want our Catholic faith to continue, to keep our children safe, that our brothers from other countries can understand that our faith is unwavering and that we feel safer, not only in Poland but also in the world."" Mateusz Maranowski, a Polish radio journalist, said he had come out to thank the Virgin Mary for his child, who was born prematurely. He said about 300 people took part in the event in the sea port of Gdynia. ""At first I wanted to pray alone on the beach but it turned out that many people from nearby parishes came out to the beach to take part in the... event,"" he said. 'Encompass the world' Halina Kotarska, 65, said she was expressing thanks for the survival of her son in a car crash, but also praying for the survival of Christianity in Europe. ""Islam wants to destroy Europe,"" she said, quoted by the Associated Press. ""They want to turn us away from Christianity."" Some priests and Church commentators said the event could be seen as support for the government's refusal to accept Muslim migrants, a policy backed by a majority of Poles. Organisers said the prayer was not directed against anyone or anything. The border was chosen, they said, because it symbolised their desire to encompass the world with prayer. Poland, along with Hungary and the Czech Republic, refused to take part in an EU deal in 2015 to relocate refugees from frontline states Italy and Greece. The Polish position has put it at odds with the Vatican, with Pope Francis urging greater acceptance of migrants on a visit to Poland last year. Bishops have urged the government to assist selected Syrian refugees but the plan has failed to secure politicians' backing.

Comic illustrator Will Morris and graphic designer David Mackenzie were commissioned to design the 492ft (150m) long strip. Called Adventures in Design, it tells its story in three sequences. Tara Wainwright, of V&A Dundee, said: ""Comic illustration is such an integral part of Dundee's creative history that we immediately understood the appeal for local audiences. ""Equally we hope this approach will inspire and excite audiences nationally, and around the world. ""It's essential to us that we engage our communities in the story of design. The comic strip provides an unusual and memorable way of starting to explore some of the ideas and themes we'll look at in the new museum."" Lorna Macaulay, chief executive of the Harris Tweed Authority, said her organisation was ""honoured"" that the Western Isles-made fabric was a feature of the comic strip. She added: ""If this is the level of creativity on the building site, I am deeply excited for what's to come inside the building when its ready."" Steve Dunlop, chief executive of Scottish Canals, which operates the Falkirk Wheel, said: ""As the world's only fully-rotating boat lift, the Falkirk Wheel is a towering symbol of the legacy of innovative engineering that can be seen along Scotland's 250-year-old canal network. ""We're delighted that its iconic design has been celebrated by this new comic strip."" Guerrilla Tea's chief creative officer Matt Zanetti said: ""Guerilla Tea is very humbled to have our story told in such a creative manner by an institution as prestigious as V&A Dundee."" Construction of the £45m V&A Dundee museum is under way on the banks of the Tay, with the Kengo Kuma-designed building due to be completed by the end of 2017.

input: Dr Wollaston, chairman of the health select committee, said Vote Leave's claim that Brexit would free up £350m a week for the NHS ""simply isn't true"". She told the BBC she did not feel comfortable being part of the campaign. Leave campaigners defend the £350m figure, saying it is the UK's gross contribution and any money received back is at EU officials' discretion. But the Totnes MP, a former GP, said: ""For someone like me who has long campaigned for open and honest data in public life I could not have set foot on a battle bus that has at the heart of its campaign a figure that I know to be untrue. ""If you're in a position where you can't hand out a Vote Leave leaflet, you can't be campaigning for that organisation."" 'Unfortunate attacks' Dr Wollaston said she thought there would be a ""Brexit penalty"" on the NHS because leaving the EU would hit Britain's economy. ""The consensus now is there would be a huge economic shock if we voted to leave,"" she said. ""Undoubtedly, the thing that's most going to influence the financial health of the NHS is the background economy. So I think there would be a Brexit penalty."" Dr Wollaston defended her decision to change camps saying ""nobody wants politicians who make the wrong decision"" and it would be ""far worse"" not to change her mind. Dr Wollaston said attacks Conservatives had made on each other during the campaign were ""really unfortunate"", and in a blog post, said the Leave campaign's focus on immigration made it look ""increasingly indistinguishable from UKIP"". In February, Dr Wollaston accused Prime Minster David Cameron of ""taking voters for fools"" for suggesting refugee camps like the ""Jungle"" in Calais could move to England if the UK left the EU. Mr Cameron tweeted that her decision to swap sides in the referendum debate was a ""powerful intervention"". Vote Leave has been urged to stop using the £350m claim by the UK statistics watchdog and the Treasury select committee but the campaign insists that although Britain gets some of the money back it does not have control over how it is spent. Cancellation of VAT on fuel Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Leave-backing Conservative John Redwood said he hoped Dr Wollaston would reconsider, but acknowledged the £350 million was the gross figure of the UK's contribution to the EU, before the rebate and the money that came back to the UK. The former cabinet minister said: ""Our Brexit budget has always concentrated on all the money we do send to them that we don't get back, which is about half of that gross total."" He added: ""I hope Sarah will think again because she, like me, thinks we need to spend more money on health. ""We can do so out of all the money that we save and we would also be able to give that cancellation of VAT on fuel to people's households."" Leave campaigner Michael Gove has urged the government to commit to spend an extra £100m a week on the NHS by 2020 if Britain votes to quit the EU on 23 June. Meanwhile, in a blow to the Remain campaign, Sir John Nott, Conservative defence minister during the 1982 Falklands War, has suspended his membership of the party because of David Cameron's ""tirade of fear"" during the EU referendum campaign, according to The Daily Telegraph. Sir John, who famously stormed out of a live interview with the BBC's Sir Robin Day during the Falklands War, is reported to believe that Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have ""poisoned the debate"" with their ""frenetic"" warnings about the consequences of a Brexit.

input: By Stephen FaircloughBBC News Speaking at the Together at Home concert for front-line workers on Sunday, Sir Tom said he was isolated for two years at his home in Pontypridd as a result of tuberculosis (TB). For Mr Twaite, from Tredegar, Blaenau Gwent, it was an experience he shared. Mr Twaite, 70, who is currently isolating with his wife due to coronavirus, contracted TB as a 23-year-old. ""I was a skeleton,"" he said. ""I was six-and-a-half stone. I was given two weeks to live. Another two weeks and I would have died."" Although he was initially diagnosed with bad flu, further investigation found Mr Twaite had an aggressive form of miliary TB, which attacked most organs in his body. This was followed by 15 months of treatment, including three months on an isolation ward at Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, where he saw very few people other than medical staff. Following his stay in Nevill Hall Hospital, Mr Twaite was transferred to Bronllys Hospital in Powys, which is now etched in his memory. ""Wow, that was an experience,"" he said. ""My room was basically a booth, with a bed and a small dressing table. I was in there most of the day. ""There were around 20 other residents who I sometimes saw around meal times. Some of the older patients were institutionalised, they were never going to leave."" 'Grim times' Mr Twaite said he spent more than six months at the facility and received very few visitors. ""It was like a military barracks. It was boring, I didn't like it, I couldn't settle. I don't remember any radio or TV,"" he said. ""They were grim times, I couldn't wait to get from there. I would sometimes go for walks in the countryside. ""I may have been outside too often. I regressed and became more ill and had to go back to Neville Hall Hospital for another 10 weeks. ""When I was released from there, I was allowed home and spent months and months at home."" Sir Tom briefly described his experiences of isolation during Sunday's concert, standing in front of a painting of his childhood home in Laura Street, Pontypridd. He said: ""I was isolated there for two years with TB in that house. I thought that was bad then, but the National Health Service helped me then like they're helping all of us now"". Mr Twaite said his experience of being isolated has led to concerns about the mental health of people who are being forced to isolate alone, after his health suffered as he returned to society. He said: ""When I came out I suffered claustrophobia. I couldn't enter a crowded room. I had nausea, panic attacks, I had to leave. ""It took me a long time to get over it.""

input: HM Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) said assaults at HMP Leeds had increased significantly since 2013. On average there are now 32 assaults on inmates and staff each month, of which about 10% result in serious injury. The National Offender Management Service said it was taking ""concerted action"" to combat legal highs. HMIP said new psychoactive substances - also known as legal highs - were a ""major factor"" in the increase in violence. Inspectors also found the use of force and segregation at the prison, known locally as Armley jail, was ""high"" and the majority of cells were ""poorly equipped"". 'Disappointing results' Levels of crowding were also found to be ""very high"", with 1,149 inmates held at the time of the inspection in December against an operational capacity of 1,219. However, inspectors found support for men with drug and alcohol problems was ""generally good"", prisoners spent a ""reasonable time"" out of their cells and the staff culture was ""basically positive and decent"". It also said that given the age of the prison - HMP Leeds was built in 1847 - the accommodation was ""reasonably well maintained and the environment was clean"". Martin Lomas, deputy chief inspector of prisons, described the inspection results as ""disappointing"" and said fundamental issues around safety needed to be addressed ""urgently"". However, he said the new governor had made a ""good start in getting to grips with these challenges"" and had a ""good understanding of the issues faced"". Michael Spurr, chief executive of the National Offender Management Service, said HMP Leeds, like other publicly-funded prisons, had to cope with a ""huge increase"" in the supply of legal highs against a backdrop of cost-cutting. He said improving safety was the ""number one priority"" and the governor and staff would ""receive the support they need to make the improvements required"". Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said the prison was failing to meet ""people's most basic need - safety"". ""How can we expect people to leave custody to be less likely to offend, if all they have experienced in prison is fear and violence?""

input: Andy Wightman said he had been threatened with possible expulsion over his concerns about the potential impact of the issue on women's rights. And he accused the party of being ""very censorious of any deviation from an agreed line"". A spokesman for the Scottish Greens said the party wished Mr Wightman well for the future. He added: ""The Scottish Greens are focused on building a greener and fairer Scotland that tackles the climate emergency, so Andy Wightman's decision not to be part of our movement anymore is a matter of deep disappointment. ""Land reform, empowering local democracy and community empowerment are core Green issues, and Andy's contribution has been very important, but the Greens remain committed to carrying on this agenda without him."" Mr Wightman is a highly-respected land reform campaigner who has been an MSP for the Lothians since 2016. In a letter to Scottish Greens co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, he said he had wanted to vote in favour of an amendment to the Forensic Medical Services (Victims of Sexual Offences) Bill in the Scottish Parliament last week. But he said he instead voted against the amendment after it was made clear to him that he would face ""complaints and disciplinary action leading to possible suspension, deselection or expulsion"" if he did not do so. The amendment will give sexual assault victims the right to choose the sex, rather than just the gender, of the medical professional who examines them. Supporters say the change is necessary to prevent female rape victims potentially being intimately examined by trans women if they do not wish to be. It was overwhelmingly backed by MSPs in a vote last Thursday - with only the Scottish Greens and Liberal Democrats voting against. Mr Wightman said he had also been admonished last year for attending a public meeting in Edinburgh to hear concerns about the potential impact of gender recognition reforms on women's rights. He described being abused at the time on social media by some trans rights activists, and apologised for the ""distress"" he had caused party members by attending the meeting. In his resignation letter, Mr Wightman said he had been saddened for some time by the ""intolerance shown by some party members to an open and mature dialogue"" about the issue. He added: ""I understand that the Scottish Green Party has a strong commitment to equalities and trans rights. ""However, some of the language, approaches and postures of the party and its spokespeople have been provocative, alienating and confrontational for many women and men. ""It has become evident to me that the sort of open-minded public engagement I would like to see take place on this topic is incompatible with a party that has become very censorious of any deviation from an agreed line."" Defamation case Mr Wightman will now sit as an independent MSP but said he remained committed to Green politics and would endeavour to ""work constructively"" with the party's five remaining MSPs until the election in May. Before being elected to parliament, Mr Wightman was best known for his Who Owns Scotland? book, which attempted to set out the amount of the country's land that was held by overseas interests, the aristocracy, companies, charitable bodies and the state. He has also campaigned for tighter restrictions to be placed on short-term holiday accommodation in Edinburgh. And he won a a defamation case earlier this year after Scottish Wildcat Haven attempted to sue him for £750,000 over statements he made in a blog post about the company's business practices. What is the trans rights row all about? Controversy over the issue has centred on the Scottish government's plans to make it easier for people to change their legally-recognised gender. The government believes the current process is intrusive and outdated, and wants to move to a ""self-declaration"" model which it says is needed to improve equality and help ensure transgender people are treated with dignity. The proposals would mean applicants would no longer need to have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria - distress as a result of a difference between their biological sex and their gender identity - or have been living as their acquired gender for two years. The government has also been considering lowering the age that a person can apply to change their legally-recognised gender from 18 to 16. The plans, which are supported by trans rights campaigners and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, have proved to be deeply controversial within the SNP in particular, with activists and high-profile politicians on either side of the debate regularly attacking each other on social media. Critics of the proposals argue that allowing people to self-identify their gender could damage the legal protections given to women under the Equality Act - including the right to single-sex spaces such as changing rooms, and women-only shortlists. A group of 15 senior SNP politicians - including MP Joanna Cherry and MSP Kate Forbes, who is now the finance secretary - signed a letter last year urging the first minister not to ""rush"" into ""changing the definition of male and female"". The letter was in response to Ms Sturgeon saying in a speech to the UN that ""some of the concerns that are expressed on the part of women and feminists are misplaced"". The Scottish government subsequently announced that it was putting the proposed changes to the Gender Recognition Act on hold while further consultations were held in an attempt to build ""maximum consensus"" on the issue.

input: Work was carried out on the gravestone because it was covered in lipstick marks left by tourists, which was gradually destroying it. Actor Rupert Everett, who has penned a screenplay about Wilde, said the tomb was ""being eaten away by lipstick"". The star attended the ceremony along with Wilde's grandson Merlin Holland. The tomb was designed by Modernist sculptor Jacob Epstein and survived almost unscathed until 1985. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Everett said: ""The Irish government have taken it upon themselves to renovate the Epstein gravestone, which is literally being eaten away by lipstick, endless women kissing it."" The glass barrier prevents visitors from touching the stonework, although tourists have already started leaving their lipstick marks on a nearby tree. Everett, who starred in the 2002 film version of Wilde's The Importance of Being Earnest, said: ""I find him very inspiring and touching, not just for his genius, also for his stupidity, in a way. ""He was a human being, and made mistakes like everyone else."" Wilde was convicted of gross indecency in 1895 and was sentenced to two years in prison in the wake of his love affair with Lord Alfred Douglas. During his trial he had attempted to explain his attitude to kissing boys and men. ""Kisses for Oscar Wilde were not just signs of love, he associated them with danger, even death,"" said Everett. Mr Holland said he was grateful to the Irish government for restoring the tomb. ""The royalties on Oscar Wilde's works disappeared many many years ago, and there's no way I could possibly have raised the money to do this myself. ""If my grandfather had been here he would have loved the attention,"" he added.

input: The girl weighed 10st 5lbs (66.1kg) - more than three times the weight of a healthy child her age - in August 2012, and she was put into foster care. The information was obtained by The Sunday Times in a Freedom of Information request. Newport council said a thorough assessment of the child and family is always considered in cases like these. In October 2012 the girl's weight rose to 10st 10lbs (67.5kg), but had fallen to 7st 7lbs (49kg) by August 2013 while she was in care. 'Comprehensive assessment' Despite losing some weight, the girl's body mass index (BMI) was still nearly double what it should be when it was measured in October. The child is one of the heaviest five year olds recorded in the UK, the newspaper found. Girls her age typically weigh around three stone. A spokeswoman for Newport council said the wellbeing of children and young people was of paramount importance when dealing with this type of case. She said: ""A thorough and comprehensive assessment of each child and their family that we work with is always undertaken. All factors will be considered in any decision that is taken. ""It would be inappropriate to comment further on this case in the best interests of the child."" A Public Health Wales report published in July found more than 28% of five-year-olds in Wales are overweight, with 12.5% of children classed as obese. Health experts said the figures were ""worrying"" but children still had time to adopt a healthier lifestyle. Lucy Davies, told BBC Wales about the healthy school initiative at St Woolos primary school in Newport. ""We run it throughout the year where we highlight and focus on a healthy lifestyle through exercise and eating healthy lunchboxes,"" she said. The heights and weights of 29,400 reception age children were collected across Wales in the 2011-12 academic year as part of Public Health Wales' first Child Measurement Programme report. The results showed that seven out of 10 children aged four to five had a healthy weight but 28% were classed as overweight or obese. Tam Fry from the National Obesity Forum wants regular monitoring of children so that problems are detected early. ""Here we have a five-year-old girl who was out and about in full visibility of people in the medical profession who really should have said 'hey, there is a girl who is far too heavy for her age'."" The problem in Wales is worse than England and Scotland, the report found. ""It's well known we in Wales have a problem with obesity, and not just in adults and middle aged people - but particularly in children,"" said obesity consultant Dr Nadim Haboubi. Food advertising, especially for high fat, highly process foods as is the amount of fast food outlets in more deprived areas and a lack of play spaces for children, is a problem according to Judith John from Public Health Wales. ""All these things can impact on whether a child grows up health or not,"" she added.

input: The men will have anonymity until their court martial finishes, Judge Blackett has ruled. The decision may be reviewed when court proceedings have concluded. All five have been charged with the murder of an unknown Afghan national contrary to Section 42 of the Armed Forces Act 2006. The incident is believed to have happened on or around 15 September 2011 while the servicemen were serving in Afghanistan. The Marines first appeared at a 'behind closed doors' hearing in October when an interim order was made, preventing the publication of their names due to a ""real and immediate risk"" to their lives. The men - who were released from custody on 22 October and sent back to their barracks - will be known throughout their court martial as Marines A, B, C, D and E. 'Lone wolves' A special hearing to decide whether the identities of the men should be released was held on Monday at the Military Court Centre in Bulford, Wiltshire, to allow the media to challenge reporting restrictions. Cmdr Blackett was given written submissions from members of news organisations, challenging the interim ban. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) also submitted a ""threat assessment"", detailing whether the men, if identified, were at risk of attack from terrorist organisations. Former defence intelligence officer Anthony Tucker-Jones also spoke after being instructed to do so by Marine B's legal team. After considering the evidence, the judge announced on Wednesday that the lives of the defendants would be put at risk if their names were revealed. Cmdr Blackett said: ""The risk comes from organised terrorist activity and 'lone wolves' who are unpredictable. ""In this respect, members of the armed forces are entitled to be treated differently from civilians within this country at this moment in history."" He added that the Marines were ""entitled to protection from terrorists"" who may plan revenge attacks. ""I am not prepared to take a chance with these men's lives,"" he concluded. If the Marines are found not guilty, the anonymity order will remain, Cmdr Blackett ruled. But if convicted, the judge said the issue of identification will be reviewed. The next hearing is scheduled for 10 December at the court centre in Bulford.

After a temporary fix, larger rocks are being used to shore up the wall from the water's edge to prevent collapse. The work was put back while the rocks were being shipped from Cornwall. Placing the rocks, which weigh up to six tonnes each, and repairing the path above is expected to take until the end of March. Portsmouth City Council said the cost of the work was estimated at £300,000 to £500,000. The authority said it planned to submit a claim to the Environment Agency's emergency support fund. Council leader Donna Jones said: ""This part of Southsea will be subject to a complete re-build in the next two to three years. ""In the meantime we have to protect the defences we've got.""

input: Stripping out the impact of currency movements, revenue at Primark for the 16 weeks to 21 June was up 22% compared with a year earlier. For the financial year to date, sales were up 17%, thanks in part to an 11% rise in shop-floor selling space. This helped to offset a big drop in revenues from AB Foods' sugar business. The company blamed lower sugar prices, weak European sales and low production in North China for the 20% fall. It added that currency fluctuations could hit overall profits for the group by £50m this year, but it still expected adjusted earnings per share to be higher than last year. Strong pipeline Primark's strong performance was ""driven by like-for-like [sales] growth, a further increase in retail selling space and superior sales densities in our new stores,"" AB Foods said. ""Strong like-for-like sales growth benefitted from the warm weather, especially compared to the very cold months of March and April last year."" Primark now has 275 stores, with total retail space of 10 million square feet, up from nine million a year ago. ""We have a very strong pipeline of new stores in Europe extending over a number of years,"" the company said.

input: Nick RobinsonPolitical editor Senior Conservatives are now considering a series of changes to strike laws to include in their election manifesto. London Mayor Boris Johnson has long argued for a minimum threshold so that a strike which lacked the support of half a union's members would not be legal in vital public services. I'm told that Downing Street prefers other options - such as minimum service agreements, used in France and other European countries - to limit the number of days of strikes possible. They are also examining tightening the rules governing strike ballots to give unions less flexibility on the timing of strike action and to widen the justification for a strike after a ballot is held. This dispute is over the closure of all London Underground ticket offices and the loss of hundreds of jobs, in what Transport for London says is an attempt to modernise the system and save money. The RMT union and others point out than when Mr Johnson first ran for mayor he promised to fight the closure of ticket offices. The Liberal Democrats resisted moves within government to change the law. One source said that, while this week's tube strike was unnecessary, that did not mean there was a need for ""half-baked legislation"". Labour has called on all parties to get around the negotiation table. Talks between Transport for London and the RMT have been taking place but RMT leader Bob Crow is eager to force Mr Johnson to join them - something he is refusing to do unless the strikes are called off.

input: By Caroline Parkinson and Helen BriggsBBC News The latest results of the new ""friends and family"" test saw one English A&E department out of 144 get a ""negative score"" - Chase Farm Hospital in London. Critics say the survey is too blunt an instrument for feedback as response rates at some hospitals are low. NHS England said the findings contained ""home truths"" but it was ""early data"" and should be treated carefully. The survey, which started in April, looked at patients who stayed in hospital overnight or attended A&E. The questionnaire, backed by the prime minister, asked the question: ""How likely are you to recommend our ward/A&E department to your friends and family if they needed similar care or treatment?"" About 400,000 people overall responded to the friends and family test data survey. Each hospital was given a score based on patient satisfaction levels, ranging from -100 to + 100. Out of 4,500 wards in England, 36 received an overall negative figure in June, although response rates in some hospitals were very low. In A&E, one hospital out of 144 received a negative score in the same month (Chase Farm in north London). The test is seen as central to the government's response to the Mid Staffordshire inquiry. The survey is projected to cost £150m a year. Tim Kelsey, NHS England's director of patients and information, said direct patient and citizen feedback was vital to improving services the NHS provides. ""From this first publication, we can see a significant and real variation in the quality of customer services across the NHS,"" he said. ""There are home truths here and everyone will expect those trusts who have large numbers of their patients choosing not to recommend their services to respond as quickly as possible."" However, he said it was important that this ""early data"" was treated carefully. He added: ""Low response rates can have a dramatically disproportionate impact on scores. As more and more patients respond, the data will become more and more robust."" Method 'simplistic' Peter Lynn, professor of survey methodology at the University of Essex, said he was concerned that differences in scores between trusts or between wards may, in some cases, be misleading. ""This can arise because the rather simplistic methodology used to collect the data makes no allowance for differences between trusts or wards in types of patients, types of treatments, or the proportions or types of patients who provide an answer,"" he said. ""Additionally, variation was allowed between trusts in the way the test was administered. Although the objective is only to shine a light on poorer-performing trusts, the concern is that the light may not be shining in the right places. The methodology of this test really should be improved."" Jocelyn Cornwell, director of the Point of Care Foundation, an independent charity working with health and social care organisations, said: ""Collecting feedback is really important, but I think the question patients are asked doesn't make sense. ""Some hospitals were using much better methods of collecting feedback. But they've had to abandon what they were doing and replace it with this rather blunt instrument."" The friends and family test began nationally in April, after a year of pilots in the Midlands and east of England. There are plans to further expand the test to maternity services in October, and to GP practices, community services and mental health services by the end of 2014, then to all parts of the NHS by the end of March 2015.

The talks concern disputes on flags, parades, the past and welfare reform. Ms Villiers said the credibility and effectiveness of the devolved institutions was on the line. 'Sensitive issues' ""We are entering a crucial few days. There's a huge amount at stake as we roll up our sleeves for what we hope will be the conclusion of this process,"" Ms Villiers said. ""The credibility and effectiveness of the devolved institutions is on the line. I cannot stress enough how important it is for all talks participants to go the extra mile. ""In the past, Northern Ireland's political leaders have shown great courage in moving forward on some very difficult and sensitive issues, and I believe the will is there to do so again now. ""The UK Government is doing all it can to help deliver an agreement. 'Strong leadership' ""This is the week for Northern Ireland's politicians to demonstrate strong leadership and engage earnestly and positively in the interests of securing stable and effective government for all in Northern Ireland,"" Ms Villiers added. A previous effort to find new mechanisms to deal with the issues of flags, parades, and the legacy of the Troubles ended without agreement last Christmas. Justice Minister David Ford has indicated more agreement was being reached in the current talks over the legacy of the Troubles. ""I certainly believe that there are very significant issues relating to legacy which were not dealt with fully a year ago when Richard Haass convened the talks, which it now appears are being dealt with in a more comprehensive and joined-up way."" 'Corporation tax' Chancellor George Osborne has said devolving corporation tax powers to Stormont would depend on the outcome of the talks. Unlike the rest of the UK, reductions to the welfare budget have not been implemented in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin is opposed to introducing the cuts, while the DUP says that the consequent reduction in Northern Ireland's block grant means that there is no choice. The shortfall is estimated at £200m. First Minister Peter Robinson and deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said they both wanted resolution this week.

input: By Brian MeechanBBC Wales business correspondent Last week he said UK ministers had ""no clue"" how to exit the EU without harm. Airbus had warned it could pull production out of the UK if it leaves the customs union and single market without a transition deal. On Friday the UK cabinet agreed a new approach to its Brexit negotiations. Airbus employs 14,000 people in the UK, including 6,500 in Wales, mainly producing aircraft wings at Broughton in Flintshire. Right direction The deal made at Chequers led to the resignation of Brexit Secretary David Davies and subsequently Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary. But Mr Enders' latest statement, says ""HM Government are going in the right direction."" Speaking at a German-British chamber of industry and commerce event in London on Monday, after the Chequers deal was made public, he said: ""We are not shy to request that Brussels and our other home countries are similarly pragmatic and fair."" Many Airbus employees from Wales also travel to the manufacturer's Filton plant in Bristol, which employs a further 3,000 people on wing assembly. A further 2,500 work at sites in Portsmouth and in Stevenage. It is estimated the aviation giant supports about 11,600 jobs in Wales alone in its wider supply chain.

input: Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show Mr Nuttall said wearing a burka or niqab in public was a barrier to integration and a security risk. He also said UKIP could undertake not to stand against Brexit-supporting MPs. Labour MP Chuka Umunna said the country would not take advice from ""hate peddlers"" at UKIP on integration. 'Good Brexiteers' The UKIP leader suggested that the party would not stand against MPs in marginal seats who supported Brexit, if local parties agreed. He cited the example of David Nuttall, Conservative MP for Bury North, who is defending a majority of 400. ""What I don't want to see happen is good Brexiteers - not fly-by-night or five-to-midnight Brexiteers, people who've campaigned for years for Brexit - I don't want to see them lose their seats and a Remainer be there in their place,"" he said. However, Mr Nuttall refused to confirm his own plans to stand as candidate in the June 8 election. ""I will make a decision in the coming week about where to stand, obviously I'll be having conversations with local branches,"" he said. ""Nothing is decided."" In February, he failed to win in Stoke-on-Trent Central, after Labour held the seat. Crash helmet Speaking about full face-veils, Mr Nuttall told the programme: ""We have a heightened security risk at the moment and for CCTV to be effective you need to see people's faces. ""Secondly, there's the issue of integration. I don't believe you can integrate fully and enjoy the fruits of British society if you can't see people's faces. ""I can't walk into a bank with a balaclava on or a crash helmet, if I can't do it and other people can't do it, I don't see why there are special interests for certain people."" Muslim women who defied the ban could face a fine, he suggested. He said that being ""hidden behind the veil"" contributed to 58% of Muslim women being economically inactive. Guide to Muslim headscarves Mr Nuttall said: ""We'll come in line with other European countries such as Belgium, Bulgaria - there's a ban for example in the city of Barcelona, some places in Italy and, indeed, Angela Merkel is talking about this in Germany at the moment. ""Manfred Weber, who's the leader of the biggest group in the European Parliament, is now talking about an EU-wide ban. We can either be on the curve on this or behind the curve."" Labour's Mr Umunna tweeted his opposition to the measure after the interview. ""Sorry,"" he wrote. ""Britain won't be taking any lessons on integration from the hate peddlers at UKIP."" 'Stop adding to the problem' UKIP member and former donor, Arron Banks - who has publically called Mr Nuttall ""weak"" - also disagreed with the policy. Mr Banks, who is hoping to run as a candidate for UKIP in Clacton, told the BBC's Sunday Politics Show: ""I'm not personally in favour of that. I think people have a right to their religious beliefs. ""I think there are certain circumstances where if it's a security issue - maybe the airports, or public transport - it's acceptable, but I'm not in favour of curtailing people's [freedoms]."" However, he stood by the previous he call made on Twitter for a ban on Muslim immigration into the UK. ""I've said that - I'm not disputing that,"" added Mr Banks. ""My answer is you can't possibly curtail someone's religious freedoms but what you can do is stop adding to the problem."" 'No place in democracy' Mr Nuttall also told the programme that he wanted to prevent Islamic sharia law becoming ""a parallel legal system in this country"". ""It cannot be right that we have court or councils in this country where the word of a woman is only worth half that of a man. That has no place in a liberal, democratic, functioning Western democracy,"" he said. But he said that Beth Din, Jewish rabbinical courts, would not be affected, because they had been established for centuries and the Orthodox Jewish population was falling. The party's manifesto is also expected to suggest that anyone with evidence of female genital mutilation taking place will be bound by law to inform police. And it will also call for postal voting to be largely abolished, because of concerns over electoral fraud. The former UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, proposed a burka ban in 2010. But the party later dropped the policy, and it did not appear in its 2015 manifesto. Full-face veils are already banned in public in some European countries, including France.

input: A military officer said he had left the historic emblems in a rucksack in his car, while on his way to the airport. The bag was later found by police in a local church after a tip-off. The gold medal is studded with emeralds and dates to the country's foundation in 1825, when it was presented to national hero Simón Bolívar. Quoted by AFP news agency, former Bolivian President Carlos Mesa compared the crime to ""the theft of the crown of Queen Elizabeth II of England"". President Evo Morales was due to wear the emblems at the annual celebration of the armed forces on Wednesday but appeared without them. The officer in question had made his way to El Alto airport, west of the capital La Paz, in order to fly to Cochabamba to give them to Mr Morales. However, the officer missed his flight and the items disappeared while he waited for his rescheduled departure. When he returned to his car, he found the rucksack was gone. The guard has been arrested and an investigation is under way, the country's defence ministry says. Containing 22-carat gold and almost 200 years old, the medal is usually kept with the sash in the vault at the Bank of Bolivia. The items are only taken out for ceremonial use. You may also like:

input: Food Standards Agency investigators said Ridiculously Rich by Alana inaccurately labelled its products. Some allergens were not listed and others were ""not correctly declared"", the agency said. A spokesman for the Aberystwyth company insisted only products sold online - less than 10% of its business - had been inaccurately labelled. But the FSA's advice to the public does not distinguish between products the company sells online or through retail and wholesale outlets. It warned that people with an allergy to soya, egg, peanuts, wheat, barley, oats or sulphites were at risk. The FSA identifies inaccurate labelling on seven of the eight cakes and bars currently advertised for sale on the Ridiculously Rich by Alana's website. The one product not highlighted as a risk by the FSA - spiced apple flapjack - is sold in mixed boxes with brandy butter brownies, which are on the list. The warning only applies to products made before 1 December this year. The company's spokesman said it had now corrected its labelling and contacted everyone who had bought its products to invite them to return their purchases free of charge for a replacement or refund. No-one has yet returned any products, the spokesman said. He declined to disclose the number of items sold with inaccurate labels. On its website, the FSA listed the products with inaccurate labelling and advised customers: ""If you have bought any of the above products and have allergies to soya, peanuts, nuts, eggs and/or an allergy or intolerance to wheat, barley, oats (gluten), milk and/or a sensitivity to sulphites do not eat it. Instead return it to the store from where it was bought for a full refund."" An FSA spokesman said it was working with the company and Ceredigion council ""to ensure that clear allergen information is available to consumers who may have purchased products with inaccurate or insufficient information."" Ms Spencer was unavailable for comment, her company's spokesman said, as she was ""filming"". The spokesman added: ""Lord Sugar was made aware of the situation immediately. ""He's spoken to Alana and is satisfied she has put the right measures in place to avoid a situation like this again."" Ms Spencer, 25, shot to fame last year when she won BBC television's The Apprentice. Her victory in the 12th series of the show secured her a £250,000 investment and a 50/50 business partnership with Lord Sugar. The company's range includes brownies, flapjacks and fudge cake and products cost £12.99 for a box of six.

input: Oliver McGowan, 18, from Bristol, was being treated for a seizure at the city's Southmead Hospital in 2016 when he was given Olanzapine to sedate him. His inquest said a rare side-effect of the drug contributed to his death. Avon and Somerset Police said it would ""interview a number of individuals"" as part of its inquiry. The force said it would then seek advice from the Crown Prosecution Service. It is understood no arrests have been made. Oliver, from Emerson's Green, was mildly autistic and had epilepsy and learning difficulties. 'Ignored in life' He was admitted to hospital on 22 October 2016 after suffering a seizure and was prescribed Olanzapine on 25 October to manage any potential psychosis. At his inquest, in 2018, his parents said they had repeatedly insisted he should not be given the drug because he had reacted badly to it in the past and because he did not have a mental health diagnosis. Oliver's temperature rose after being give the drug and he showed signs of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) - a rare side-effect. He died on 11 November. The coroner ruled the medication was appropriately prescribed but concluded Olanzapine had caused Oliver to suffer from NMS, which was a ""a significant contributory factor"" in his death. In a statement, his mother Paula McGowan said: ""Oliver's voice was wilfully ignored in life and up until now has been muted in death. ""We embrace the police doing a full and thorough investigation. Oliver made it clear to paramedics and doctors he was not to be administered anti-psychotic medication. ""We, as Oliver's parents, knew him best and told all doctors that we did not give permission for anti-psychotic medication to be administered."" A North Bristol NHS Trust spokesperson said: ""We will not be commenting on an ongoing police investigation.""

He has not had any visitors so far after doctors advised him to rest - but his family are said to have been in contact by phone. The duke spent four days in hospital over Christmas, following an operation to clear a blocked heart artery. And after attending events to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee in June, he was admitted to hospital for five nights, missing several days of festivities after sustaining a previous bladder infection.

input: Mexico's Guillermo del Toro won best director and his The Shape of Water took the top honour for best film. Chile's A Fantastic Woman was named best foreign language film and its star Daniela Vega became the first openly transgender woman to present at the ceremony. Coco, a film with a Mexican Day of the Dead theme, won best animated feature. How many awards did Latin America bag? Well, that depends on your definition of a Latin American film. There is no doubt that Mexico did extremely well by getting the two most coveted awards of the night. Guillermo del Toro, the 53-year-old from Guadalajara, won both best director and best picture. His film, The Shape of Water, also won best original score and best production design. But the score's composer is French musician Alexandre Desplat and the three men honoured for the film's production design and set decoration, Paul Denham Austerberry, Shane Vieau and Jeff Melvin, are all Canadian. Coco, the best animated feature, definitely has a Mexican theme even if it was made by California-based Pixar Animation studios. Not only is the animated feature set in Mexico, it deals with the annual celebration for which Mexico has arguably become most famous around the world, the Day of the Dead. Oh, and its co-director, Adrián Molina, is Mexican-American. There is no doubt about the Latin American credentials of the best foreign language film, A Fantastic Woman. The Chilean film's director, Sebastián Leilo, was born in neighbouring Argentina but the drama is both set in Chile and its main star is Chilean transgender singer Daniela Vega. Is the Latin American influence a new trend? Hardly. Mexican directors have won four out of the five best director Oscars since 2014. In 2014, Mexico City native Alfonso Cuarón became the first Latino to win the award for Gravity, his film about two astronauts stranded in space. In 2015, another Mexico City native, Alejandro González Iñárritu, followed suit with Birdman. Not content with just the one best director statuette, he added another the following year for The Revenant. The spell was briefly broken by French-American director Damien Chazelle, who won with La La Land last year, but Mexicans are certainly hoping for more top awards in years to come. And with three directors who are well established in the cinema world and arguably at their height of their careers (Cuarón, González Iñárritu and del Toro are all in their fifties), the chances are looking good. What about Latin American actors? Touchy subject this one. No Latino actors were even nominated for any Oscars this year. The last time a Latin American actor was nominated was in 2012. That was Demián Bichir for A Better Life. The first and only Latino to ever win the Oscar for best actor was Puerto Rican actor José Ferrer for Cyrano de Bergerac. Don't remember that? That may be because it was all the way back in 1951. More recently, Benicio del Toro won best supporting actor for Traffic but that now dates back 17 years. Women have fared little better. While Puerto Rican actress Rita Moreno stole the show at this year's award by presenting in the same dress she wore when she won best supporting actress in 1962, there has been a dearth of awards since. That is, unless you count 2014 best supporting actress Lupita Nyong'o, who Mexicans proudly consider as one of their own thanks to her being born in Mexico City. The lack of Latino representation in the film industry is an issue the National Hispanic Media Coalition has tried to raise awareness of in the run-up to the Oscars. So overall a Latin American success? Judging by the reaction on social media, where Guillermo del Toro's name trended, the 2018 did highlight the achievements of Latin American filmmakers, if not of actors. One Latin American actor who came in for a quite a lot of teasing on social media was Mexican actor Gael García Bernal. Bernal sang the opening lines of ""Remember Me"" from the film Coco, which won the Oscar for best original song, before Mexican singer Natalia Lafourcade and US singer Miguel took over. And while some lauded his stab at singing, many on social media suggested he had better keep the day job of acting.

input: Health Secretary Andrew Lansley has appointed a trust special administrator to go into the trust. Mr Lansley said: ""Past efforts have not succeeded in putting the South London Healthcare Trust on a sustainable path."" The trust has run up debts of more than £150m since being created in 2009. It is the first time an NHS trust has been put into administration. The trust was created by merging three hospitals - the Princess Royal in Orpington, Queen Mary's in Sidcup and the Queen Elizabeth in Woolwich - and serves more than one million people. Last year it finished £69m in deficit on a turnover of £424m. As well as struggling financially, the trust also has some of the longest waiting times for operations and longer-than-average waits in A&E. However, it has low infection and death rates. If a decision was made to break up the trust, it would not necessarily mean the closure of all services. Another more successful NHS organisation or private provider could end up taking some on. But for that to happen, there would need to be a formal process of review and consultation. Mr Lansley said the decision to put the trust into administration followed a recent statutory consultation with the trust board, the strategic health authority and local NHS commissioners. Matthew Kershaw, who works as the national director for provider delivery at the Department of Health, has been appointed as special administrator. 'Be bold' His role will take effect from 16 July and he will ""assume full control"" of the trust, replacing the functions of the trust's board and ""assuming the role of the accountable officer"", the health secretary said. Mr Lansley added: ""At this point, and pending the outcome of the regime, the chair and directors are suspended from their board duties in accordance with the legislation. ""However, some of the executive and non-executive directors will support the trust special administrator in the work he leads during the regime."" Mr Kershaw will examine the long-standing difficulties at the trust before publishing a draft report on 29 October. This will be followed by a month-long consultation with staff, patients and the public. A final report will be submitted to Mr Lansley in January 2013. Mr Kershaw said: ""My priority is to work with staff, patients, the public and all those involved in healthcare services in the south-east London area to maintain high quality, effective services during the running of the Unsustainable Provider Regime. ""Together we will need to think differently, be bold and accept that change needs to happen. The status quo is not sustainable."" Mr Lansley added: ""This will be a big challenge and my key objective for all NHS trusts is to ensure they deliver high-quality services to patients that are clinically and financially sustainable for the long term. ""Although there have been some improvements in mortality rates, maternity services and infection control, and some early signs of improvements in waiting times, they do not go far enough. ""It will be impossible for South London to build on these improvements while tackling such a large deficit."" Sue Slipman, chief executive of the Foundation Trust Network, a trade association which represents NHS trusts, said: ""All eyes will be on the process which, if it works as intended, will resolve the situation swiftly and ensure there is minimum disruption to patient care while allowing services to be delivered more efficiently.""

input: Paul Elsey, confirmed as the suspect to the BBC by his father, is from Swanage. Murder detectives are focusing their forensic investigations on homes, cars and an area near a coastal path where women's clothing was found. Miss Pope's family confirmed the clothing matched what she was believed to be wearing the day she went missing. Mr Elsey is the third person to be arrested in the inquiry. He is believed to be known to 19-year-old Miss Pope, who went missing from Swanage on 7 November. Mr Elsey lives with his mother Rosemary Dinch, 71, who, along with her 19-year-old grandson, Nathan Elsey, was arrested on suspicion of murder on Monday. The pair were released on Tuesday while inquiries continue. Forensic investigations are continuing at two properties in Manor Gardens, where those arrested are believed to live. Police have also seized three vehicles. A black jacket Miss Pope was wearing in CCTV images taken at St Michael's Garage, Swanage, on the last day she was seen was recovered from an address in Manor Gardens. Search activity involving coastguard teams and Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue's Technical Rescue Unit is focused on several fields nearby. Det Supt Paul Kessell, of Dorset Police, said: ""The clothing located south of Priests Way appear to be Gaia's and her family have confirmed they match what she was believed to have been wearing the day she went missing."" In a statement posted on the Let's Find Gaia Facebook group, her mother Natasha Pope said she was ""holding on to hope"". ""I believe in this community and I believe miracles can happen,"" she said. ""My eternal thanks to everyone who is out there searching for my little girl. Please come out over the weekend and do what you can."" Miss Pope's cousin, Marienna Pope-Weidemann said the family were ""desperate for answers"" and urged people to ""get out there looking for her"". ""It's been a profoundly shocking 24 hours. Obviously the discovery of those clothes was incredibly distressing for the whole family,"" she said. Search volunteer Ian Messenger, who works at Swanage Dairy, said people were ""pulling together"". ""It's just been surreal,"" he said. ""The town seems sort of subdued at the moment, it's usually quite vibrant. ""Everyone's out searching at night, early in the mornings. We at the dairy, we've handed out over 1,000 leaflets to all of our customers with our milk."" Nico Johnson, editor of the local Purbeck Gazette, said the search effort was ""phenomenal"". ""We've got people walking for miles and miles in teams, they've covered towns, rural areas, gone door-to-door in coordination with police. A lot of information has been brought forward,"" she said. ""Purbeck is a really strong community, when something happens they are fully behind each other. People are getting to the point of exhaustion - they just want to find Gaia now.""

input: By Helen BriggsBBC Environment correspondent Researchers used freely available maps and data to identify the specific farms and ranches clearing forests to produce soya and beef destined for Europe. They found 2% of properties were responsible for 62% of illegal deforestation. These ""bad apples"" have global environmental consequences, they said. Prof Raoni Rajão, of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais in Brazil, said it was up to the country's political and economic leaders to root out ""the bad apples in the soy and beef sectors"". ""Brazil has the information it needs to take swift and decisive action against these rule-breakers to ensure that its exports are deforestation-free,"" he said. What does the study show? Reports from non-governmental organisations and journalistic investigations have previously revealed cases of soya and beef being produced in areas of deforestation and exported. But this is the first study to link property-level illegal deforestation with export data. The research, published in the journal Science, found that 2% of properties in the Amazon rainforest and the Cerrado grasslands are responsible for 62% of all potentially illegal deforestation. Roughly 20% of soya exports and at least 17% of beef exports to the EU may be ""contaminated with illegal deforestation"", the researchers said. According to their analysis, two million tons of soya grown on properties with illegal deforestation may have reached EU markets annually during the period of analysis, 500,000 of which came from the Amazon. As the soya is fed mainly to livestock, customers can't be sure whether the meat they buy is ""deforestation-free"". Duncan Brack, of the Chatham House think tank, said the study strengthened the argument for government measures to end UK consumers' contribution to deforestation, such as a due-diligence or duty-of-care obligation on companies importing products such as beef or soya. What is the scale of the problem? A recent report found the majority of all soya (65%) comes from countries with high deforestation rates. The land required overseas to meet the UK's annual demand for soya between 2016 and 2018 equated to an area approaching the size of Wales, according to environmental groups WWF and the RSPB. ""Without knowing it, we're eating meat and dairy products from animals fed on soy grown on deforested land in Brazil,"" said Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at WWF-UK. ""We need to stop importing habitat destruction."" In 2019, an area of primary forest the size of a football pitch was lost every six seconds across the world, according to a study by the University of Maryland, US. Brazil accounted for a third of it, its worst loss in 13 years apart from huge spikes in 2016 and 2017 from fires. Follow Helen on Twitter.

If Doncaster Council's plans are approved, the hub could be open by the spring of 2020. The plans will be considered on 4 July. More stories from across Yorkshire The museum and art gallery, and the central library are in two separate 1960s town centre buildings, with the archives in a former school in Balby, and the school library service at Barnby Dun. Doncaster Council said all four buildings needed ""significant repairs"" and even money spent on them would not make them fit for purpose. However consolidating all four into one unique building would create a ""cutting edge space"" and a wonderful resource for residents, Mayor Ros Jones said. Doncaster Girls' School was built in 1910 and extended in 1935. It merged with Doncaster Boys' Grammar in 1971 to become Hall Cross Comprehensive, but was mostly demolished by 2013. A boutique hotel promised for the site never materialised. The council said a new hub would ""inspire creativity"" and encourage new visitors to the town. Exhibits not seen in public for years could be displayed, including the Danum Shield, Royal Borough Charters and collections celebrating Doncaster's links with railways, horseracing, mining and Roman history. Bob Fitzharris, chair of the Freemen of Doncaster, said it would be ""absolutely marvellous"" to see the school frontage restored to its former glory with all services together under one roof. Ms Jones said the ""landmark building"" would enhance Doncaster's cultural heritage and be ""a total step change to what is currently being offered.""

input: Nick Ramsay wanted to stop a meeting of the Monmouth Conservative Association (MCA) from going ahead next week. But his application for an injunction has been withdrawn and a judge ordered Mr Ramsay to pay £25,000 in costs. Mr Ramsay said he had wanted clarification from MCA to ""ensure no further damage was caused."" At the virtual hearing at Bristol Civil Justice Centre, Mr Ramsay's injunction application was withdrawn, and a judge said if the application to injuct had been made it would have failed. Judge Paul Matthews said Mr Ramsay has 28 days to make the costs payment to the successful party - MCA chair Nick Hackett-Pain, on behalf of its members - and no permission was granted for appeal. Mr Ramsay said he withdrew the application after the MCA ""changed their position at the eleventh hour"" and claimed he was the victim of a ""witch hunt"". He added: ""I still do not know what I have done and that has still not been disclosed. There are a few bad apples who I believe have poisoned the barrel."" The MCA spokesman said it was ""absolutely delighted"" with the ruling. ""We hope that Mr Ramsay recognises the right of this association to conduct itself in a democratic fashion,"" he added. Mr Ramsay's future in the Senedd will be considered on Monday, where members will discuss a petition to deselect him. If the petition is approved, another meeting would be required to formally deselect him and he would then be allowed to take part in the final reselection process. But Mr Hackett-Pain said he believed ""very few"" members would be willing to campaign for Mr Ramsay after he had attempted and failed to injunct the association. He told BBC Wales that ""members of the association are not going to be impressed when their own candidate sues their own association"". Fellow Tory David Davies, MP for Monmouth, welcomed the decision to ""defend the right of the association"". Mr Davies wouldn't make comment on Mr Ramsay directly but said: ""All elected members owe their positions to voluntary associations and therefore I cannot personally conceive of a situation ever in which if the association wanted a meeting with me I would rush to lawyers and threaten them with my costs. I would never ever behave in that fashion."" One source told BBC Wales more than 50 members had signed a petition against Mr Ramsay, which amounts to more than a tenth of the association's 500 members. It is the second legal action Mr Ramsay has staged this year, after the politician took the Welsh Parliament's Conservative leader Paul Davies to court over his suspension from the Senedd Tory group. It is understood that central Conservative Party officials will be involved in running the meeting on Monday and taking votes. However, it would not trigger deselection alone, and if members agree with the petition's premise further discussions would be needed for deselection to happen.

input: Imaging revealed language was based in the exact mirror opposite region to the normal left side area. Georgetown University researchers hope their work will help the rehabilitation of adult stroke patients. A UK expert said the brain had an ""incredible ability"" to make up for what was lost in a stroke. It's estimated that one in 4,000 babies are affected shortly before, during or after birth by a stroke. The plasticity of babies' developing brains makes them better able to recover from a stroke than adults. The research, which is being presented to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) annual conference in Austin, Texas, looked at 12 perinatal stroke survivors aged 12-25. The case studies had few indicators that they had experienced a stroke - one had a limp and many had learned to make their left hands dominant because of the stroke damaging the right hand's function - but all had developed good language skills. However they found that, because their brains were developing when they had the strokes, they were able to adapt. Elissa Newport, a professor of neurology and director of the Centre for Brain Plasticity and Recovery at Georgetown University, led the study. She says: ""These young brains were very plastic, meaning they could relocate language to a healthy area, (but) it doesn't mean that new areas can be located willy-nilly on the right side. ""We believe there are very important constraints to where functions can be relocated. There are very specific regions that take over when part of the brain is injured, depending on the particular function. ""Each function, like language or spatial skills, has a particular region that can take over if its primary brain area is injured. This is a very important discovery that may have implications in the rehabilitation of adult stroke survivors."" The study is now being extended to a larger group, and will look at whether functions other than language are relocated, and where. They are also carrying out more research into the molecular basis of plasticity in young brains in order to try and work out how to ""switch on"" plasticity in adults who have suffered a stroke or brain injury. Strokes in babies Dominic Brand, from the Stroke Association, said this was a small study. But he added: ""We do know that the brain can have an incredible ability to reorganise undamaged cells after a stroke, and make up for what has been lost. ""In many cases, with the right support, stroke survivors of any age are able to walk, talk and live independently again. ""But there is much more research that needs to be done to help us fully understand how the brain can recover after a stroke.""

input: Mark UrbanDiplomatic and defence editor, BBC Newsnight The title sums it up really, for the word ""priorities"" hints at the cuts to come, but the promise of sustained leadership speaks of a superpower status that even this current White House does not have the courage to abandon. For decades during the Cold War, the Pentagon doctrine was to maintain a ""two war military"". The idea was that the US could deal with two major adversaries in different places at the same time. This was not just an abstract concept - spending decisions involving hundreds of billions of dollars were based on it. So, for example, the US marines maintained major task forces both in the Pacific and Atlantic, complete with dozens of ships and hundreds of aircraft in order to be able to carry out major amphibious operations in both places at the same time. During the past 20 years the US has cut its forces and Pentagon people started bandying about concepts like a ""one-and-a-half war military"". That meant being able to fight one major and one lesser adversary at the same time. Shift to Asia-Pacific Why did they bother with these ideas? The US, with its sense of global leadership and ""manifest destiny"", did not want to admit to its own people that it was scaling back its ambitions in order to save money. Its strategists were also intensely aware that some enemies to US interests might take a crisis in one part of the world that sucked in the US military to be a green light to start trouble in another. In today's world, with the Obama administration looking to save anything up to $1tn on defence between now and 2020, there is a new and even more tortured formulation. Today's paper says, ""even when US forces are committed to a large-scale operation in one region, they will be capable of denying the objectives of - or imposing unacceptable costs on - an opportunistic aggressor in a second region"". It is not a two war military, but a war in one place and bit of a nuisance elsewhere military. As to the geographic and spending impact of this, the paper is clearer. The US is re-ordering its strategic priorities: ""We will of necessity rebalance toward the Asia-Pacific region"". Europe, the Pentagon says, is better able to look after its own business now, so American commitments in this part of the world are, ""evolving"". This is a polite way of saying what Robert Gates, the previous defence secretary said more baldly, that having seen the paltry defence efforts that Europe is willing to make, its time for the US to drawdown. Subtlety of language In its new posture, the US will cut hundreds of thousands of soldiers and marines - precisely the people who have done the lion's share of the bleeding in Afghanistan and Iraq. The US will seek other means to deal with such missions, says the document, and, ""US forces will no longer be sized to conduct large-scale, prolonged stability operations"". Here too though the administration is trying to have things two ways. President Barack Obama always wanted to end the Iraq war. For a while he tried to win in Afghanistan, but now wants out of there too. However the underlying message about US willingness to take on terrorist or non-state groups is still strong. The Obama administration does not choose the same language about pre-emptive military action that President George W Bush's National Security Strategy espoused, it expresses a similar idea in a more subtle way: ""The United States will continue to take an active approach to countering these threats."" We know this means drone strikes in Yemen or killing Osama Bin Laden in a raid unauthorised by the Pakistani government. Here too then, the message seems to be that America will pursue similar objectives, but try to achieve them at a lesser cost in lives and treasure. The proof or otherwise of this approach will be seen in whether the likes of Iran, North Korea, or even China act more boldly than they would have done in time when the US felt more bullish about its defence.

input: They have argued that the prosecution case was weak and inconclusive and said ""a jury must convict on substance rather than suspicion."" Constable Carroll was shot dead in Craigavon in March 2009. Brendan McConville, of Glenholme Avenue, Craigavon and John Paul Wootton of Collindale, Lurgan, deny the murder. On Wednesday, the defence team again attacked the evidence of a man known as Witness M, who claims to have seen 40-year-old Mr McConville at the murder scene half an hour before the shooting. Mr McConville's barrister said the evidence was of poor quality and a case of mistaken identity. He also argued that a coat that had Mr McConville's DNA on it and found in the alleged getaway car could have been worn by up to five other people. The lawyer told Belfast Crown Court that a tracking device hidden on the car by the Army had shown that it had not been near Mr McConville's home on the day of the shooting. ""There was always a danger,"" he said, ""of seeking to manufacture a hypothesis to match the evidence"". In conclusion, he added: ""The essence of the secondary submission being that the inferences drawn are weak and inconclusive and the same ought not to be combined so as to leave the jury to convict on suspicion rather than real substance."" In opening his final submissions, a barrister for 20-year-old John Paul Wootton claimed there was a breakdown, a distortion, in the forensic evidence over a coat found in his car and the legal proofs absolutely essential to link it with the shooting and Mr Wootton. Later, he accused the scientists involved of ""lacking in candour and frankness as to the validity of their conclusions"". He said it was ""lamentable"" that those involved have failed to acknowledge openly in court their failures and the invalidity of their results remained unknown to them for over three years. The lawyer further claimed that there was no scientific basis for the findings concerning firearms residues and those allegedly found in the back of Wootton's car and supposedly on a jacket. He claimed it was ""all conjecture and not supported by evidence"". He also claimed that when the tests were being carried out, even the most basic procedures, ""that even an intern would have been aware of"", were not taken. The barrister further claimed that the number of particles recovered from the jacket were ""not consistent with the person wearing that jacket, firing a firearm on the 9 March, or consistent with a person firing that firearm, seeking to conceal that firearm in the jacket wishing to take it from the scene"". He added the forensic results were also not consistent with the jacket being used to wipe that weapon after it had been discharged.

input: Hundreds of people, mostly students, had marched peacefully through the streets of the capital Caracas. But security forces later clashed with a group of demonstrators who threw stones and home-made explosives, and tried to erect barricades. More than 40 people have been killed during three months of unrest. Wednesday's march was called by university students to demand the release of more than 200 people who were detained after security forces broke up protest camps last week. The government said the camps were being used as bases to launch ""violent attacks"" and to hide ""drugs, weapons, explosives and mortars"". 'No proof' But a university student at the march, Alex Gomez, rejected the accusations, saying ""there was never a problem due to drugs, weapons, or alcohol"". ""We are demanding that they show us the reasons why they arrested them,"" he told the Associated Press news agency. A student leader, Juan Requesens, vowed they would continue demonstrating despite the arrests. ""The government is trying to suppress us by continuing to detain students. We will not bow down and will continue our protests,"" he told the Efe news agency. Since 12 February, Venezuela has seen a wave of violent demonstrations that were triggered by discontent over high inflation, rampant crime and food shortages. The government has labelled the protesters ""fascist agitators"" and accused them of fomenting a coup against the left-wing President Nicolas Maduro. In a report published last week, the pressure group Human Rights Watch accused Venezuelan security forces of illegally detaining and abusing protesters. The latest clashes come a day after the Venezuelan opposition threatened to boycott ongoing talks with the government. The two sides began meeting last month in an attempt to find a way out of the crisis.

input: Barry Stanley-Wilkinson says he wrote the report four years before BBC Panorama revealed the alleged abuse of patients with learning disabilities and autism. The CQC said the draft report raised no concerns about abusive practices. The claims come after 10 workers at the specialist hospital were arrested. Seven men and three women were arrested last week at addresses in Barnard Castle, Bishop Auckland, Darlington and Stockton over the alleged abuse of patients. An undercover BBC Panorama investigation into the specialist hospital in County Durham - a 17-bed unit for adults with learning difficulties and autism - appeared to show patients being mocked, intimidated and restrained. Cygnet, the firm that runs the 17-bed hospital unit for adults with learning difficulties and autism, said it was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the allegations. The company only took over the running of the centre at the turn of the year and said it was ""co-operating fully"" with the police investigation. 'Poor culture' The site had at least 100 visits by official agencies in the year before the alleged abuse was discovered. Mr Stanley-Wilkinson says he noticed a ""very poor culture"" was evident when he led the 2015 inspection. He told the BBC that he had raised concerns over the ""very poor culture"" in a report he wrote - four years prior to the BBC investigation. He said: ""I strongly believe that anybody that can understand organisational culture reading that report would agree that there was definitely warning bells there. ""I was extremely upset. This should have been listened to back in 2015 and I said quite openly, when I left the organisation, that I felt it had neglected its promise to people with learning disabilities."" He said it was the only report he wrote in nearly a decade of working at the CQC which wasn't published. In a statement, the CQC said the report went through a ""rigorous peer review process"". It said the draft report ""did not raise any concerns about abusive practice"". The CQC said a later inspection rated the hospital as ""good overall"". In a statement it said: ""We are in the process of commissioning a review into what we could have done differently or better in our regulation of Whorlton Hall and these allegations will be fully investigated as part of this. ""We will update on the progress and findings of this review in our Public Board meetings.""

input: Swansea Crown Court was told Malcolm Fyfield had been warned about the existence of underground water, which later flooded Gleison drift mine. David Powell, 50, Charles Breslin, 62, Philip Hill, 44, and Garry Jenkins, 39, died in the incident in 2011. Mr Fyfield and mine owners MNS deny manslaughter charges. Up to 650,000 gallons of water swept through a closed-off section of the mine known as ""the Old Central Workings"" following the use of explosives, the jury heard. Mr Fyfield was one of seven men working in the mine at the time and survived after he crawled out through sludge and dirt. Prosecutor Gregg Taylor QC told the court Mr Fyfield should have known about the existence of the underground water and made a ""catastrophic error of judgement"" in miscalculating where he thought the water line was. ""Malcolm Fyfield [showed] a disregard for the safety of his workers. The risks he took can only be described as staggering,"" he said. ""Malcolm Fyfield intended to breach the Old Central Workings. He must have thought he could breach the workings without causing any danger to anyone. ""Malcolm Fyfield had been warned by many people about the existence of water in the old existing workings. ""Malcolm Fyfield decided to go his own way. It was his responsibility to follow the regulations and mine practices. ""Even if he did not believe there was any danger of an inrush it was still his duty to give his reasons to the mine's inspector."" 'Catastrophic error' Mr Taylor highlighted two sections of the Health and Safety Executive's code of practice, which states it is the ""duty of the manager"" to ensure ""water or material that flows"" does not rush into a mine. Another section says workers should be at least 37 metres away from potentially hazardous areas, he said. Mr Taylor also pointed to a hand-sketched map of the area the men were exploring before the incident on 15 September, 2011. It showed an area being considered to extract coal from, with the word water written twice. Mr Taylor claimed the drawing was done by Mr Fyfield and said he should have known where it was safe to dig for coal. The jury was told Mr Fyfield had passed the required training needed for working in mines where underground water is present and had a ""sound working knowledge"" of the regulations. Giving evidence, Simon Cooke, a deputy licensing manager for the Coal Authority, told the court Mr Fyfield was ""meticulous"" in submitting monthly and quarterly reports to the organisation. He confirmed he had also given Mr Fyfield a reference for a job application. The trial is due to last until at least the end of June.

input: By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor Shares in the firm dipped by as much as 12.8% after Tuesday's launch. It has been suggested the game was not ready for release. Ubisoft has also been criticised for delaying reviews until after the title had gone on sale. The French company said that it was working on fixes. ""We are currently working on our next update that will help address some of the specific issues some players are having including: [the protagonist] Arno falling through the ground; game crashing when joining a co-op session; Arno getting caught inside of hay carts; delay in reaching the main menu screen at game start,"" it said. In a further statement, Ubisoft added that the complexity of creating a multiplayer title, in which players join forces via the internet, was the reason that the game had only became available for review relatively late in the day. However, it did not explicitly address the point that it had made reviewers agree to an embargo time set 12 hours after the game went on sale on the east coast of the US. Consumers have posted screenshots and videos online, indicating that problems affect all the platforms the game has been released on: the Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and PC. A patch was, however, provided on the launch day to tackle ""random crashes"" and some animation issues. ""The glitches are so bad that it's become a source of mockery,"" said Rob Crossley, UK news editor of Gamespot. ""There are characters that float past the screen, the main protagonist walks in the air, people are falling through the floor, people's faces are disappearing mid-kiss. ""If a publisher has proven it can't publish a game properly and displeases its core user base, then I think there are legitimate questions to be made about how well the company will fare in the future."" Released date delays Assassin's Creed: Unity is set in the French Revolution, and its simulation of Paris streets and buildings is more complex than anything attempted in the franchise before. It also marks the first time Ubisoft has released two core Assassin's Creed games simultaneously - the North America-based title, Assassin's Creed: Rogue, was made for last-generation consoles. The company had been under pressure to meet the titles' scheduled release dates after announcing lengthy delays to other high-profile games: Watch Dogs, which ultimately went on sale about a year later than expected, and The Crew, which is running roughly nine months late. ""It shows that Ubisoft struggles to deliver products on the timelines that it's given, and if it does deliver them on time they may not be finished,"" said Mr Crossley. ""I would say that delaying a game for the sake of quality is a much more commendable solution than releasing it in fear."" 'Anti-consumer' Video games news site Polygon has led criticism of Ubisoft's post-release embargo. ""There's no valid reason for a review embargo such as this; it's blatantly anti-consumer and likely designed to get the first rush of hardcore fans into the stores to buy their copies of the game before the reviews hit,"" wrote the site's editor Ben Kuchera. ""Any embargo past midnight the night before is sketchy as hell. It's a way to weaponise embargoes, and the best thing to do is to hold off until you can read about the game in detail."" Two other high-profile games - Activision's Destiny and Sony's Driveclub - also had post-release embargoes placed on them this year, while Sega did not send out any pre-release copies of Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal at all. All three titles subsequently received mixed scores. But a spokeswoman for Ubisoft denied her firm had acted out of a lack of respect for customers. ""The nature of games themselves and the way they are being reviewed is changing, as evidenced by games like Assassin's Creed Unity, Destiny and The Crew - games that have significant online components,"" she said. ""Having the online elements available and having populated worlds is essential to creating a representative and complete experience for reviewers. ""Achieving this prior to launch is incredibly complex, which is why some games are being reviewed much closer - or as was the case with Destiny, even after - the game launches. ""We are working to adapt our services and communications with consumers accordingly, both by changing the way we work with reviewers and by offering customers open betas or other early access to some games, all so that they have the information they need and want."" But Mr Crossley joined calls for a rethink. ""Embargoes beyond the release date instantly raises suspicions - whether they are true or not - about the quality of a game,"" he said. ""I don't see the logic in doing it.""

input: PC Darren Booth, 40, was said to have propositioned her while he and a colleague responded to reports of anti-social behaviour in Castleford in 2019. A misconduct hearing was told that he went to her flat alone and suggested the complainant arrange a threesome. The officer denied the allegations and claimed he was set up but was dismissed without notice. The misconduct hearing was told PC Booth and a colleague met the woman, known as Miss A, and her friend, Miss B, when they were dispatched to Castleford town centre on 7 March last year. It heard the West Yorkshire Police officer began flirting with Miss A before saying he wanted to ""meet up on a regular basis to have sex"". He then made further sexual comments when he visited her flat at the end of his shift, the panel was told. 'Sexually motivated' The officer had claimed he only went to the address to gather intelligence on counterfeit cigarettes and wanted men. But the panel's independent chairman Geoffrey Payne said the officer's explanation for being there alone after midnight was not credible. When two police sergeants arrived at the flat after being tipped off by Miss A, Mr Payne said, PC Booth offered no explanation as to why he was there and ""looked anxiously at the floor"". Although PC Booth was of exemplary previous character and Miss A was an alcoholic former drug addict with a string of convictions for dishonesty, this did not mean the panel would automatically believe him, Mr Payne said. The panel concluded the officer's actions towards Miss A had been ""sexually motivated and exploited the power imbalance between them"".

input: By Andrei Zakharov & Anastasia NapalkovaBBC Russian Service Here lie clues to why a farm that once provided work to some 400 Russians was unable to survive. Like many of the collective farms in rural Russia, the Mayak farm collapsed with the old Soviet Union. That is when the Chinese workers arrived, in five border regions, and Russians have not always been happy to welcome their new neighbours. ""Working in Russia is much the same as in China. You get up in the morning and go to work,"" says Chom Vampen. He is one of thousands of Chinese who have moved to this vast, under-populated part of Russia since the early 1990s. Most seek work at Russian- or Chinese-owned farms or buy the lease on the land to develop their own agricultural enterprises. As Russia's relations with the West have deteriorated, President Vladimir Putin has welcomed China's growing footprint here. Mayak's chairman, Yevgeny Fokin, leased thousands of hectares to Chinese entrepreneurs, attracted by low rents and large farms. ""We gave the shares to Fokin, thinking it would be better if the land belonged to the collective. But he gave it all to the Chinese and left, and we lost everything,"" a local resident of Maksimovka village, Tatyana Ivanovna, said. ""No way,"" says Mr Fokin. ""There was nothing unusual about it."" How Chinese companies took over Chinese companies first appeared in Russia's Far East in the early 2000s, but Beijing's interest in the region increased after the global financial crisis of 2008. ""There was panic, [the Chinese] were looking at where to invest,"" the head of a Chinese-owned farm told BBC Russian, preferring not to give his name. Chinese investment was followed by an influx of Chinese migrants. ""We have little land and a lot of people,"" said one Chinese farmer. Based on data released by the state land register, BBC Russian calculated that Chinese citizens either owned or leased at least 350,000 hectares (3,500 sq km) of Far Eastern land in Russia. In 2018, around 2.2 million hectares of Russian land in the region was used for agricultural purposes. The actual proportion could be higher, the BBC has learned. Chinese farmers are, according to BBC research, represented in 40% of the Far East, most significantly in the Jewish autonomous region of Birobidzhan. Regional governor Alexander Levintal said that in many cases land officially leased by Russians was in reality managed by Chinese nationals. ""Almost all the land that belonged to collectives was handed over to the Chinese,"" said the head of the Jewish autonomous region's peasant association, Alexander Larik. Why relations are uneasy Most of the farms run by Chinese migrants resemble fortresses. At Babstovo, a half-hour drive from the Chinese border, lies Friendship farm, which is surrounded by a high fence and a red flag. But things are different in the village of Opitnoye Polye, where Xin Jie employs Russian as well as Chinese workers. Like many Chinese here, he adopted a Russian name and is now known as Chinese Dima. Chinese Dima moved to Russia in the 1990s and leased more than 2,500 hectares of land to develop a soya plantation. He is actively involved in the community, buying presents for nursery school children and sending his tractor to help clear the snow in remote villages in the winter. Few have integrated quite as well. Conflicts between Russians and Chinese are not uncommon. In 2015, three Russians entered a Chinese factory in the Far Eastern Amur region and threatened a Chinese guard with a stick, demanding he give them food. A few days later, when they returned to steal a tractor engine, they were confronted by the same Chinese guard who this time carried an axe. They were given prison sentences ranging from five to nine years. Most Chinese cross the border for seasonal work, for sowing or harvesting, and then return home. But many Russians are unhappy with the Chinese influx. More than one in three people said they viewed China's Russia policy as expansion, according to a poll conducted in 2017 by the Russian Academy of Sciences. Almost half said that China threatened Russia's territorial integrity, while a third believed that it endangered their country's economic development. ""They leave at seven in the morning and return after dark. I don't see them and they don't see me,"" says Ivanovich of his Chinese neighbours in the village of Dimitrovo. But some Russians have struck up friendships with the Chinese. ""They bring beer, we drink. I give them eggs and honey,"" says Alexander. Why Russian workers struggle to compete Chinese farm workers in Russia's Far East often have a better reputation than their Russian counterparts. ""The Chinese do not drink and they have nowhere to run; they come here for the season. Our citizens come to work for a week, plead for money and then go on a bender,"" complained one Russian agricultural boss who declined to give his name. Mr Larik, of the peasant association in the Jewish autonomous region, said Chinese farm owners generally preferred hiring Chinese migrants and gave Russian nationals low-skilled jobs. A Chinese farmer who asked to stay anonymous complained about the drinking habits of Russian employees. ""All Russians drink. Today you pay them, tomorrow they do not show up. There are problems with discipline,"" he said. Russia has a poor record of protecting workers' rights, especially in the agriculture industry, which is generally low paid. Not everyone here has a low opinion of local workers. ""What is the difference between Russian and Chinese workers? Russian workers are smarter than the Chinese,"" says Chom Vampen. Translation by Katherine Zeveleva.

input: By Joice Etutu and Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check Some fear vaccine ""hesitancy"" could be increased by false and misleading information shared online. We've been investigating some examples. 'Human guinea pig' claims In the early months of the pandemic, a video was widely shared online of two French doctors discussing the initial testing of a possible vaccine in Africa first, before being tried elsewhere. The comments, which led to an angry response on social media, fuelled existing concerns that Africans could be used as ""guinea pigs"" for a future Covid-19 vaccine. But that didn't happen - vaccine trials got under way in sites spread around the world. The Oxford University vaccine team, for example, initiated testing in the UK and later in Brazil and South Africa. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had clinical trial sites in Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Turkey, South Africa and the US. Claims about vaccine priority list In June, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced initial advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) on who might be first in line for a vaccine, including health and social care workers and those at increased risk of serious disease from coronavirus. He added that ""we will continue to take into account which groups may be particularly vulnerable, including those from ethnic minority backgrounds. So we can protect the most at risk first should a vaccine become available"". But his comments were greeted with suspicion by some and sparked more claims about ethnic minority people being used as ""guinea pigs"" for the vaccines. A black British woman posted a video in June saying, ""why should these vaccines be trialled on me and my people"". In the end, ethnic minority groups were not included on the priority list, which includes the elderly, those in care and frontline health workers. The video - which has had around 50,000 views - also falsely claimed that people had already died from the ""trial vaccines"". There were no deaths caused by vaccines administered during the Pfizer and Oxford trials. Want to know more about vaccine safety? Vaccine ingredients Some of the most persistent myths surround the contents of the vaccines. We've previously dealt with false claims that they contain microchips, aborted fetus cells or that they can somehow alter our human genetic code (DNA). None of these are true. But there have also been specific concerns over whether they may contain ingredients that are forbidden under religious beliefs. Rumours that vaccines contain traces of pork (not eaten by Muslims) or beef (cows are considered sacred by Hindus) have been circulating online, particularly within South Asian communities. It's true that some other non-coronavirus vaccines have contained gelatine derived from pork, added as a stabiliser. However, none of the Covid-19 vaccines currently approved for use in the UK contain gelatine. In fact, the body that approves vaccines has made it clear that the Moderna, AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines ""do not contain any components of animal origin."" ""We need to be clear and make people realise there is no meat in the vaccine, there is no pork in the vaccine,"" says Dr Harpreet Sood, who is leading an NHS anti-disinformation drive. He adds that this ""has been accepted and endorsed by all the religious leaders and councils and faith communities"". A history of unethical experimentation Some of the anti-vaccination discussion online has referenced cases of mistreatment of black people by the medical establishment in the past. The Tuskegee scandal is one example. From the 1930s, and lasting for several decades, hundreds of African American men had their syphilis left untreated without their knowledge as part of an experiment. Dozens suffered terribly and died and the case remains one of the worst examples of racism from the field of medical research. More recently the case has been used to stoke fears about medical malpractice in the black community online. There is of course no evidence of any unethical practice in any of the vaccine trials. The teams behind the research say they have ensured a diverse range of trial participants. To take the example of the Pfizer trial in the US, 10% of participants were black, 13% Hispanic, 6% Asian, 1.3% Native American, with the rest white. ""While it's important to acknowledge unethical experiments on black people, to ensure those in power don't let it happen again, using these examples to deter people from taking the coronavirus vaccine is exploitative,"" says Dr Winston Morgan, reader in toxicology and clinical biochemistry at the University of East London. ""Trying to compare what happened [then] to what's happening now is wrong.""

input: By Kevin RawlinsonBBC News Patrick McDonald told officers in Florida that he took out the weapon, despite the firm's firearms ban. The two got into an altercation when the driver tried to forcibly remove Shane Fabry from the car. Uber said Mr McDonald, 67, has been suspended and that it would co-operate with police. Mr Fabry and his fellow passengers told police they were picked up by Mr McDonald on Friday last week as they made their way home. During the journey, Mr Fabry said he felt ill and asked the driver to pull over in case he was sick but, when Mr McDonald did so, the passenger said he felt fine to continue after all. Mr McDonald was accused of trying to drag Mr Fabry out of the car by his arm, telling him he must not be sick in a $75,000 (£52,600) vehicle. They said the driver took up an ""aggressive fighting stance"" and that, after a verbal altercation, he drew a black semi-automatic gun from the driver's side. In sworn statements, the passengers said the Uber driver pointed the gun at Mr Fabry. While Mr McDonald admitted to police that he drew the weapon, he said he did not point it at his passenger. According to the police report filed with the Manatee county sheriff's office, he said he had ""grabbed it (the gun) because he was in fear for his life"". The report read, that when asked exactly how he was in fear, he said he had heard the passengers making threats. The 67-year-old driver was released on bail by police in Florida, where the incident took place. He is due to appear in court on Tuesday morning on charges of aggravated assault, with a further appearance on a charge of battery scheduled for 19 February. Uber spokesman Bill Gibbons told the local paper, the Bradenton Herald, that Mr McDonald's account was deactivated while the firm investigated the incident. ""We stand ready to provide law enforcement with any information that would be helpful to their investigation into this matter,"" Mr Gibbons said, adding that Mr McDonald started working as an Uber driver in mid-January. The background checks carried out by Uber, which does not employ its drivers directly, have been criticised in the past, including by a California district attorney and the UK's Licensed Taxi Drivers Association. It was reported in June last year that Uber changed its firearms policy to ban weapons after one of its drivers shot someone soon after dropping off a passenger in his car. But, later that month, the Washington Times reported that another Uber driver was accused of shooting a passenger who was allegedly choking him, despite the policy. Roger Chapin of the Florida Taxicab Association said that the latest incident came as the state's lawmakers were considering a bill to ""strip away virtually all regulations for Uber"". They are due to vote on the draft law shortly. ""Uber can do their screening but it may not be enough,"" Mr Chapin said. ""If Uber is the only one with the names of their drivers, how can the public verify they are following the rules?""

input: By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News They focused on ""night owls"", whose bodies drive them to stay up late into the night. Techniques used included consistent bedtimes, avoiding caffeine and getting plenty of morning sunshine. The researchers say their approach may seem obvious, but could make an important difference to people's lives. Everyone has a body clock whose rhythms follow the rising and the setting of the sun. It is why we sleep at night. But some people's clocks run later than others. Morning-led ""larks"" tend to wake early, but struggle to stay up in the evening; night owls are the opposite, preferring a lie-in and remaining active late into the night. The problem for many night owls is fitting into a nine-to-five world, with the morning alarm waking you up hours before your body is ready. Being a night owl has been linked to worse health. Scientists studied 21 ""extreme night owls"" who were going to bed, on average, at 02:30 and not waking until after 10:00. Their instructions were to: After three weeks, people had successfully shifted their body clocks two hours earlier in the day, the analysis by the University of Birmingham, University of Surrey and Monash University showed. The results, in the journal Sleep Medicine, showed people still got the same hours of shut-eye. But they reported lower levels of sleepiness, stress and depression, while tests showed their reaction times also improved. ""Establishing simple routines could help night owls adjust their body clocks and improve their overall physical and mental health,"" said Prof Debra Skene from the University of Surrey. ""Insufficient levels of sleep and circadian [body clock] misalignment can disrupt many bodily processes, putting us at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes."" One of the main cues the body uses for syncing with the passage of the sun is light - hence advice to expose the body to more during the day and less at night. Having inconsistent sleeping and waking times can also disrupt the body's internal clock (known as a circadian rhythm). The techniques deployed may seem like obvious sleep hygiene advice, but each is used to help train the body clock. What the researchers did not know was whether those hard-wired to sleep late would respond to the change of habits. ""What isn't obvious is, when you have these extreme night owls, can you do anything about that?"" Dr Andrew Bagshaw, from the University of Birmingham, told the BBC. ""These are relatively simple things anyone can do that makes an impact, and that to me is surprising. ""Being able to take a decent chunk of the population and help them feel better without a particularly onerous intervention is quite important."" Follow James on Twitter.

England should now be offered its own devolved institutions, the MPs said in a recent report. ""We believe the 'English question' needs to be addressed,"" they said. An answer to this question should also involve changes to the procedure in the UK Parliament on legislation that affects England only, they suggested. 'Micro-managed' ""Of all the tectonic plates within the Union, it is England which most needs to be lubricated and adjusted to the new reality,"" the committee said. ""The government should now, with all urgency, create a forum... for the people of England to discuss if, and how, they wish to follow in the footsteps of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and access substantial devolved powers, clearly defined in statute, for their local communities."" The committee said ""the largest nation of the Union is still micro-managed from Whitehall"", predicting that this would ""continue to cause tension"". It noted that the situation could not yet reasonably be described as a ""constitutional crisis"", but it added: ""It is better to identify and analyse potential weaknesses in our constitutional framework before a crisis arises."" A future devolved administration for England could have ""the tax-raising powers that Scotland possesses, and that are proposed in Wales,"" the committee suggested. The MPs argued that recent years have been marked by ""a huge amount of incremental constitutional change"". Thwarting the ""natural desires of people to run their own affairs has been a contributory factor to antagonism towards Whitehall and Westminster"", they added. Once ministers had ""swiftly"" resolved the ""English question"", they should arrange a ""UK-wide constitutional convention"", the committee also suggested. ""Changes over the last 15 years have continued to alter our political and constitutional arrangements at a rapid pace,"" it said. ""Some believe that the time is right to step back and consider what effect these constitutional changes have had on the UK as a whole, and what the future of the Union could look like.""

input: Scientists at Cardiff University say they want to build up a map of ""roadkill hotspots"" in the hope it can cut wildlife casualties on the road. The project, called Operation Splatter, is asking the public to sign up as ""splatter spotters"" and send their findings via social media. The team have already studied hundreds of otter carcasses found as roadkill. Project Splatter is encouraging people to report via Twitter and Facebook what animals they have found dead at the roadside, and where. Running since January this year, recent updates have included reports and the locations of badger, red deer, roe deer, pheasants, grey squirrel, rabbits and foxes. A spokesperson said: ""Cardiff University's Project Splatter aims to reduce wildlife road casualties in the UK using data supplied by the public through social media."" It is an extension of the Cardiff University Otter Project, run in collaboration with the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), which examines around 200 otter carcasses a year, most of them roadkill. The latest findings of the project were also been unveiled at the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff as part of the BBC Summer of Wildlife series of events. Visitors to the event were told that the research had found a number of disease-causing parasites in bodies of dead otters. The infection Toxoplasma gondii, which is spread in cat faeces, was identified in 39.5% of the otter carcasses examined. More work is to be carried out to determine its effect on otters. In humans the parasite can lead to miscarriage and retinal abnormalities. Almost a fifth of the otters examined, 18.3%, were found to be carrying parasitic flatworms, mostly two species, Pseudamphistomum truncatum and Metorchis albidus. 'Previously unknown' Affected otters were found to have inflamed or thickened gall bladders. Any fish eating mammal can be infected by the parasites, including humans. About a quarter of the otters, 24.3%, carried the tick Ixodes hexagonus. Up to 122 ticks were found on some animals, with younger otters likely to have more than adults as they are more likely to spend more time in the holt [den]. Dr Elizabeth Chadwick, who leads the team, said: ""The project's research on the parasites that infect otters has revealed previously unknown aspects of their distribution and ecology. ""Continued work is necessary to help us to better understand their transmission pathways and the impacts that they have on otters, other wildlife and human health. ""

It has written to operator Northern, warning that more carriages are needed during the peak tourist season. Northern said it was doing all it could to improve services. Volunteers from the LLRUG act as ""welcomers"" who travel on trains offering advice on services and places of interest to passengers, who are mainly tourists during the summer. 'Disgrace and disgusting' Robert Talbot, the group's chair, said: ""[Northern] seems to think 'we've ticked that box, given them trains, what more do they want?'. ""But they've failed to look at the issue of the length of the train. ""What the foreign visitors must think of this - as a welcome to the Lake District - heaven knows."" The group has written to Northern outlining its concerns. The letter detailed an account from one of the volunteers which reported that ""upwards of 300 people"" were crammed on board one train. At least 100 people were standing ""crammed in the length of the corridors and the vestibules"", the volunteer noted. He described it as a ""disgrace and disgusting what cattle truck conditions passengers were having to put up with"". Northern said in a statement: ""We have responded to the letter from LLRUG to advise that we are doing all we can, especially at the weekends, to improve services and have standby buses in position when required.""

input: By Roland HughesBBC News The ship was the only one to save anyone from the sea - 28 people were taken on board. It was not the first time it had carried out a rescue - earlier in the week, it took 480 migrants to Sicily. Reports in the Italian press said the Portuguese ship had carried out rescues on at least two other occasions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) estimates that merchant ships rescued 40,000 people from the Mediterranean in 2014. It expects that number to increase substantially this year. But shipping companies feel they are being made to play too large a role in bringing people to safety - and say governments should pay for better surveillance of the seas. No compensation Merchant ships are legally bound to rescue those in need, under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Stopping to help those in distress is also seen, as the IMO says, as ""a longstanding maritime tradition"" as well as a moral obligation on the ship's master. However, ships are not compensated for helping in rescues or if they are fined for arriving late at port with any deliveries. One vehicle carrier that helped the search for survivors on Sunday, the Maltese-registered City of Lutece, saw its delivery to Pasajes, in Spain, delayed by more than 36 hours. Ships are also at risk of being in breach of their safety certificates by taking on board more passengers than have been legally agreed upon. Andrew Linington, a spokesman for Nautilus, a maritime trade union, said: ""These days, a merchant ship operates with an average crew of 20. ""So if you go to the rescue of sometimes several hundred people, it can compromise the safety of the entire ship. There is no accommodation for them, the ships are sailing with a minimum amount of food and there are not enough life-saving appliances."" Designed to deter A further issue, Mr Linington said, is the design of the ships. ""Most ships are designed to pick up only a limited number of people in distress,"" he said. ""A lot of the ships that go to the Mediterranean have been in the Middle East and have been through problem areas like Somalia, so they are actually equipped with stuff to deter people from coming on board."" A spokesman for the Allianz insurance firm, that specialises in insuring ships, said vessels were covered under the 1982 UN Convention, and that companies would be recompensed if the ships were damaged during a rescue. But the issue of whether merchant ships are insured to carry migrants is a grey area. Maritime insurance companies told the BBC that it depends on ships' individual insurance agreements. Also unclear, they said, is where liability would fall should migrants die or be injured while being rescued by a merchant ship's crew. Michael Kingston, a maritime lawyer and partner at the DWF law firm in London, said the law was clear about merchant ships' duty to rescue. But he said there was a need for a wider enforcement programme. He said: ""The Italian government have to be commended for what they are trying to do, but I find it staggering that other countries from the EU can't immediately meet to discuss the loss of over 1,000 lives in a week. ""From a funding point of view, there's an obligation on everyone. These migrants are no different to migrants in the past, who were forced to leave their country."" In the mid -1970s, while working on a merchant ship in Asia, Allan Graveson helped rescue a group of boat people fleeing Vietnam. He sees parallels between now and then - when almost 800,000 Vietnamese nationals were resettled after fleeing the Communist victory at the end of the Vietnam War. ""I looked down into the boat and all they wanted to do was hug me,"" he said. ""There were five of them - four hadn't made it and they'd put them overboard. It was the children who were the first to die. ""We picked them up. It's what you did, there were no questions."" Mr Graveson says a similar response is needed now. ""Back then, the UN High Commission for Refugees had camps in Singapore - people landed there, they were given money and sent to new countries. That can work today. ""It took a while to get camps going then. There was prevarication, like now. A lot of what's being said now was being said then. But it worked.""

He also presented the network's Newsday programme since its launch in 2012. The programme's producers described him as a ""warm, calm and surefooted presence in the studio."" ""Julian also presented the programme from a long list of countries, often finding himself in the middle of some of the biggest news stories we've covered,"" they said in a tribute package. The piece hears Julian reporting in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the run-up to elections and in Venezuela as the full scale of the economic crisis began to emerge, as well as in the Central African Republic at the height of the violence between rival militias. William Edmundson, a senior journalist at Newsday, paid heartfelt tribute to his colleague. ""Julian wasn't just a close friend, he was a great broadcaster,"" he told the BBC. ""He found the real person behind the interview because he was patient, cared and wanted to get it right. And with each person comes a story. ""Over decades in the studio and dozens of trips we worked to get those stories on air. We both knew how lucky we were to have the opportunity. The only consolation is that we made the best of the time we had. "" Thomas Dahlhaus, Newsday's deputy editor, added that Keane worked hard to pass his passion and wisdom on to new journalists entering the industry. ""I've never seen anyone help, mentor and support so many people, junior presenters and producers alike,"" he said. Some colleagues also posted tributes on Twitter, including former co-presenters Shaimaa Khalil and Ben James. And, of course, tributes were paid to Keane in his natural home - on-air. ""We don't usually like to make the story about us, but I hope you agree this warrants it,"" Newsday presenter Lawrence Pollard told viewers. ""Julian Keane, a much loved and respected presenter on the show has died at only 57. Funny and talented, Clever and handsome, he was such a charming man it was impossible to object to his unfeasible array of qualities. ""To which we can now add bravery and consideration for others in the face of terrible illness. Julian won awards for his reporting and was someone we all learnt from by working with him over his 25 plus years. ""Needless to say, he would have written and read this better than I can.""

input: The new Department of Labor filings bring the number of jobless claims over the last four weeks to more than 20 million. That amounts to roughly as many jobs as employers had added over the previous decade. The economic crisis comes as the number of US virus cases exceeds 629,000. The surging joblessness is a stark reversal for the world's biggest economy where the unemployment rate had been hovering around 3.5%. Economists now expect that rate to have hit double digits. While the 5.2 million new claims in the week ended 11 April were down from 6.6 million the previous week, the numbers still eclipse prior records. Many economists warn that elevated numbers will linger, with Goldman Sachs researchers expecting some 37 million claims by the end of May. ""Records are being broken left and right with respect to the depth and breadth of the current downturn,"" said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. ""With no immediate end in sight to efforts aimed at mitigating the virus' spread and impact, it is impossible to see a near-term upturn in employment prospects."" 'The phone rings and rings' Electronics chain Best Buy this week said it would furlough more than 50,000 employees, while Royal Caribbean Cruises announced it would cut or suspend about a quarter of its American workforce. The moves come as retail sales plunged by a record 8.7%, while manufacturing output dropped by the most in more than 74 years. The US has expanded its unemployment programme, making disbursements bigger and more people - including the self-employed - eligible. But requests to participate have overwhelmed state offices, which process the applications. Glenn Hawker, co-owner of a now-closed hair salon in Virginia, said he had applied for the funds as an independent contractor at least twice and been rejected. When he called to figure out why, he couldn't reach anyone. ""The phone rings and rings and rings,"" the 49-year-old said. Mr Hawker had also sought assistance through a loan programme for small businesses, but he has not received any. On Thursday, the Small Business Administration, which is in charge of administering that $349bn programme, announced it had run out of money. 'Worse and worse' Restaurant owner George Constantinou last month laid off most of the 130 people who work at the four businesses he owns in New York and New Jersey, retaining a core group to continue doing take-out and delivery. He said he expected the move would allow the business - which saw sales drop some 80% in the early weeks - to conserve money and workers to receive at least some pay until he could bring them back. ""I honestly thought this was a two-week thing,"" he said. ""Then it just got worse and worse and worse."" Amid delays to claims processing, some staff have sought his help in applying for food stamps. If the economic downturn is prolonged, re-hiring everyone may not make sense, even after he can fully reopen. ""At this point, we have to take it almost day by day to figure it out,"" he said. US President Donald Trump is expected to issue ""new guidelines"" for reopening the economy in parts of the country where experts believe the rate of infection is under control. ""There has to be a balance,"" he said on Wednesday. ""We have to get back to work.""

All schools will receive a basic £116 more per pupil this school year than in 2018-19. However, the department said that due to the increased cost of teachers' pensions, the money schools would get per pupil would stay at 2018-19 levels in real terms. ""The department has increased the 2019-20 aggregated schools' budget by £7.25m to maintain the age weighted pupil unit (AWPU) cash value at 2018-19 levels and £54.6m to mitigate the increase in teacher pension costs from 1 April 2019,"" it said. ""The 2019-20 AWPU cash value has been maintained at the 2018-19 level, when the additional funding to mitigate the increase in teacher pension costs is excluded."" School budgets in Northern Ireland have decreased by around 10% in recent years. That has meant that almost half of schools in Northern Ireland are in budget deficit. There have also been a number of recent warnings that school budgets are under increasing pressure with particular concerns around support for pupils with Special Educational Needs. About three-quarters of the funding a nursery or primary school gets from the department is based on the numbers of pupils it has. In post-primaries, almost 85% of the funding they get from the department is based on pupil numbers. Weighting value Primary and nursery schools will receive around £579m through the department's common funding scheme in 2019-20, compared to around £553m in 2018-19. Post-primary schools will receive a total of £650m in 2019-20, compared to £614m last year. Due to a weighting value attached to each pupil, post-primary schools receive significantly more money per child than primary schools. Last year, the cash value of the vast majority of primary and nursery school pupils under the common funding formula was £1,998 per pupil. However, in 2019-20 that has risen to £2,114 per pupil. A weighting value attached to each pupil means that primary schools will actually receive £2,283 per pupil. Post-primary schools will receive £2,172 per pupil in 2019-20 compared to just under £2,056 last year. However, a higher weighting value means that post-primaries will receive £3,649 for each pupil in years 8-12 and around £4,518 per sixth form pupil.

input: By Roland HughesBBC News It's one of those lines we might use every day here at the BBC, and it sounds serious. So our apologies if we've never explained what this actually means. What does the process involve? What does it aim to achieve? Is it really that serious? We spoke to four summoned ambassadors to ask them. John Casson - former UK ambassador to Egypt In August 2015, three journalists from the al-Jazeera network were sentenced to jail in Egypt for ""spreading false news"". Outside court, Mr Casson spoke on Egyptian television in Arabic to condemn the sentence. Soon after, Egypt's foreign ministry said it had summoned him to attend its offices. In doing so, it used one of the few diplomatic tools a host country has when it wants to make its anger felt to another country. ""I was called by the foreign ministry and was told 'We need to see you immediately,'"" Mr Casson tells the BBC. ""The first thing they said was, 'We are not summoning you, but we are going to tell the press we are summoning you. If it had been a summoning, we would have sent a formal diplomatic note summoning you.'"" This is the way things normally work in a summoning - a formal, polite, diplomatic note is sent to the relevant country's embassy asking - but not really demanding - its representative to attend a meeting at the foreign ministry, or its equivalent. The medium of the summoning is the message, Mr Casson says. ""The main thing is that it is a piece of diplomatic theatre and everybody understands their role, and acts their role,"" Mr Casson, who was in Cairo between 2014 and 2018, says. In London, the drama can involve being made to wait in the grand surroundings of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, to understand the seriousness of the occasion. ""The interesting question,"" Mr Casson asks, ""is that if this is theatre, who is the audience?"" In this case, he says the audience was the Egyptian public, who needed to understand their government was fighting back against perceived foreign interference in their judicial system. But summonings by themselves are unlikely to make the ambassador's country change its approach, Mr Casson says. ""It isn't completely useless - it's a way of saying, 'Let's not build up a head of steam.' It's a symbol of serious political will but not on its own - it needs to be backed up by other stuff. It doesn't make the government think 'Crumbs'."" Ichiro Fujisaki - former Japanese ambassador to the US Mr Fujisaki, a former Japanese ambassador to the United Nations, also served as its representative in Washington between 2008 and 2012. In December 2009, he was summoned by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This was notable for two reasons: this is not something the US state department does often, and Japan is a close ally of the US, so an unlikely subject of a summoning. The Washington Post reports Mrs Clinton was ""blunt, if diplomatic"" with Mr Fujisaki. ""It was rather unusual,"" Mr Fujisaki says. ""But I thought the American government wanted to convey their message rather rapidly."" The message in question was about plans to move the US military base in Okinawa. There was just one problem: the new Japanese Prime Minister, Yukio Hatoyama, opposed details of the move. And so, Mr Fujisaki was called to the state department in the middle of a snowstorm, when all other government buildings were shut, to hear Mrs Clinton's view: the military base was being moved, end of story. Although Mr Fujisaki was widely reported to have been summoned, he disputes the use of the word - and says no-one in the diplomatic service uses it. ""A summoning sounds like you are obligated to be there, it's more legal,"" he says. ""In this case, the government is asking you to be there, it's a request."" Mr Fujisaki says the ambassador must speak to his home government so that they do not learn of the summoning through the media. The home government would then brief the ambassador on the most appropriate way to respond and what points they should make. Ambassadors can be summoned in inconvenient circumstances - as when Israel's foreign ministry called on 12 countries' representatives on 25 December 2016, when many were away for Christmas. So was making Mr Fujisaki travel across a city in a snowstorm a way of inconveniencing him, and reinforcing the state department's unhappiness? He says not. Peter Beckingham - former UK ambassador to the Philippines Mr Beckingham may be the only ambassador summoned by his hosts over a TV comedy sketch. In 2008, the BBC show Harry and Paul featured a sketch in which one character encouraged another to ""mount"" a Filipina maid. The sketch caused outrage in the Philippines and was called ""completely disgraceful"" and ""distasteful"". Cue the summoning by the Philippines Foreign Minister Alberto Romulo. ""I knew him very well,"" says Mr Beckingham, who is now retired. ""We had played golf on one occasion and we had been to each others' homes. ""I think he probably knew the BBC was an entirely separate organisation from the British government, but he felt he had to remonstrate about that item. It was an entirely civil conversation and I remember we spent a greater time talking about British history and politics, about which he knew a great deal. ""They then issued a pretty stern press release which I don't think entirely matched the conversation we had. But that was the point of the exercise - that they could say they had challenged the British government."" Ilir Bocka - Albania's ambassador to Serbia Mr Bocka, the Albanian ambassador in Belgrade since 2014, is in an unusual position: he once refused a summoning by his host country. Four months into his ambassadorship, Albania's football team travelled to Serbia for a Euro 2016 qualifying match. About 40 minutes in, the match was stopped when a drone flew overhead carrying an Albanian nationalist flag. A brawl broke out, and the match was abandoned. Soon afterwards, Mr Bocka received a demarche from Serbia's foreign ministry - a polite request for him to attend, rather than an order. ""This is the most common way diplomacy is done,"" Mr Bocka tells the BBC. ""You are asked to go, normally to the director, and you have to hear what they have to say, and at the same time, you have the right to express your position."" A year later, it was a different story. Before the return match in Albania's capital Tirana, the Serbian team bus was pelted with stones and window was cracked. Cue the summoning, and a cranking-up of diplomatic pressure. ""They asked me to go immediately to the foreign affairs ministry but I said no,"" Mr Bocka says. He did not feel the stoning of a bus merited his summoning. ""I knew what had happened: nothing! It was 22:00, I said 'maybe tomorrow', but they wanted to have this story on the TV, so I said 'No, I'm not coming'. I told them I wouldn't play this game."" Mr Bocka acknowledges how rare it is for an ambassador to reject a summoning by his host country, and the refusal was not without consequences. For several months afterwards, he was disinvited from foreign affairs ministry events, even while his staff continued to work unhindered. But he stayed in his job, and four years later, is on good terms with his hosts again. ""Our relations were damaged for a moment,"" he says. ""But now? It's OK.""

It seems to be only US-based users that can see the question, which is appearing under every post on their Facebook page. While some have criticised the social media giant for the move, others are calling it a bug and pointing out the more unusual places where they have seen it appear. A Facebook spokesperson said they were unable to comment at this time. You may also like: If users click ""yes"" to respond that the post does contain hate speech, they are presented with four options for feedback. These options are ""hate speech"", ""test p1"", ""test p2"" and ""test p3"", prompting some people to suggest that the form ""clearly wasn't supposed"" to appear on Facebook in its current form. Yet the hate speech button was criticised as suppression by some, with American writer Matt Walsh calling it an intentional move by Facebook to remove ""conservative content"". This is in light of accusations from Republican congressman Steve Scalise that Facebook's algorithm was discriminating against conservative news and content in favour of liberal posts. And Lebanese-American journalist Brigitte Gabriel labelled it an attempt by Facebook to ""censor"" her account. But as others noticed the button appearing on all of the posts in their timeline, people began to share the funniest place they had seen the button appear. Such places include posts about local churches, articles about Donald Trump, and even pictures which show the weather forecast. And Washington Post journalist Gene Park shared this suggestion that a photo of a puppy might be somehow hateful. This comes as Facebook hosts its biggest event ever, with 5,000 developers flying in from around the world for the F8 developer conference on May 1-2. This prompted social media journalist Matt Navarra to joke that even Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg was not exempt from the hate speech button. By Tom Gerken, UGC & Social News

input: By Katie ShepherdBBC News, Washington DC President Donald Trump's first major legislative push came to a halt last week as the American Health Care Act (AHCA) failed to be given a vote. Much of the blame for the bill's failure was placed on the Freedom Caucus, a secretive group of Republicans who refused to get in line behind Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Mr Trump. The Freedom Caucus emerged in 2015, in response to complaints that then-Speaker of the House John Boehner tried to jam through legislation in defiance of House rules - specifically, legislation they thought wasn't conservative enough. The caucus is ""concerned about procedure, but also concerned about procedure because they're concerned about policy,"" said Dr Laura Blessing, a senior fellow at the Georgetown Government Affairs Institute. The group formed to restore power to the rank-and-file Republicans, and lead the charge in opposition to the Affordable Care Act. Popular ideals among Freedom Caucus members include balanced budgets and shrinking the size of government. How disastrous for Trump is healthcare collapse? During the Obama administration, members drummed up so much resistance to Mr Boehner's approach to budget cuts and legislation that the speaker chose to resign rather than face a bitter intra-party battle. Knowing exactly who is in the Freedom Caucus and how they will vote is tough. Joining the caucus is an invitation-only affair with a secret membership. They assemble in closed-door meetings. Individual members often refuse to commit to a vote before consulting the rest of the caucus. ""These folks really do stick together,"" Dr Blessing said. ""You don't really have any moderate Republicans left in the Republican conference, but these folks are markedly more conservative than their colleagues."" Therein lies their power. The Freedom Caucus has about three dozen members, or a little more than 15% of House Republicans. As a voting block, it's enough to upset the 237-193 advantage Republicans have over Democrats. Assuming a bill gets no Democratic support, Ryan cannot afford to lose a mere 23 Republican votes. That means the Freedom Caucus can make or break a bill. Though the Caucus itself took no official position on the Trump-endorsed AHCA, meaning members could vote how they chose on the bill, most members of the Caucus wanted a full repeal of the existing healthcare law known as Obamacare. When they didn't get it - or what they felt was a good-faith negotiation from President Trump - they refused to vote for the AHCA. Moving forward, Dr Blessing expects to see turbulence between the Republican leadership and the Freedom Caucus on issues like tax reform, the federal budget and infrastructure spending - a costly endeavor that won't sit well with a group in favour of austerity. That leaves Paul Ryan, tasked with drumming up support for his party's bills, facing a difficult choice. ""If he tries to get Democrats' votes, he's going to pay a price within his conference,"" Dr Blessing said. Courting the Freedom Caucus may have fewer political consequences, but ""he's going to face the challenge of negotiating with people who haven't had a history of negotiating much"". There's not much incentive for Freedom Caucus members to start negotiating now. Many moderates also disliked the bill, but weren't so public - or unified - in their opposition. The Freedom Caucus is facing much of the blame for the failure of the healthcare act, and they lost one member, Ted Poe, who said that their obstinacy was counterproductive. ""Saying no is easy, leading is hard, but that is what we were elected to do,"" he said. However, individual members are polling well, and the president is not. In Washington, that's where the real power lies.

""Southeastern continually aims to improve the service it provides to passengers and the local communities it serves,"" it added. Mr Clark, the Conservative MP for Tunbridge Wells, has been liaising with the borough's Rail Travellers Association on what passengers would like to see as part of the extended contract. Chairman Bob Baker said ""cost, reliability and passenger experience"" were necessities.

Alun Davies said threatening legal action ""sounds like the last breath before you're thrown out of the pub"". Mr Davies said he was not convinced the Welsh Government would ""have a leg to stand on"" in trying to shape international trade deals after Brexit. Following Donald Trump's comments during last week's trade visit that the NHS would be ""on the table"" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was ""absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation."" The US President then rowed back on his initial comments following criticism from a number of MPs. Asked about her response to President Trump's remarks as she gave evidence to the Assembly's Brexit committee on Monday, Ms Morgan said ""legally, it would be difficult for us to stop because we don't have a veto over trade"". ""Politically, I think it's extremely unlikely to happen,"" the international relations and the Welsh language minister said. ""They [the UK Government] should not be concluding any trade agreements without consulting us where we have the power."" Ms Morgan explained that UK and Welsh government officials are working on an agreement or 'concordat' for how future trade deals are negotiated.

input: The canvases, Sea View at Scheveningen and Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church at Nuenen, date from Van Gogh's early period and are described as priceless. However, Dutch culture minister Jet Bussemaker said their real value would be in the eyes of those who can now see them again. Thieves seized the canvases from the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam - which contains the world's largest collection of Van Gogh works with more than 200 paintings and 500 drawings - after breaking in through the roof. One of the men convicted over the theft, Octave Durham, has revealed that he was actually after the artist's better known works, but they were harder to steal. He told a documentary to be aired later that he found it ""trivially easy"" to break in to the museum. ""The heist took about three minutes and 40 seconds,"" Durham says in the film, the New York Times reported. ""When I was done, the police were there, and I was passing by with my getaway car. Took my ski mask off, window down, and I was looking at them."" He said he and his accomplice had wanted to steal Sunflowers but the artwork was too well guarded, Trouw newspaper reported. They then turned their attention to The Potato Eaters, considered the painter's first masterpiece, but decided it was too big to fit through the hole they had entered through. Durham told the filmmakers he had selected the seascape because the thick paint convinced him it would be valuable. He was arrested a year later in the Spanish resort of Marbella and convicted in 2005, but had until now maintained he was innocent. The theft was a case of ""art-napping"" by an opportunist burglar, art investigator Arthur Brand told the BBC. ""No art collector will pay for stolen art they can't display,"" he said. But stolen art could be used as leverage by criminals who offer its return in exchange for reduced sentences for their crimes. Dutch criminal Cor van Hout - who became notorious for kidnapping the beer tycoon Freddy Heineken for an estimated $10m (£8m) ransom in 1983 - wanted to buy them but he was gunned down in a gangland hit before the deal could be done. Another potential buyer met the same fate and the paintings were eventually sold to Raffaele Imperiale, a low-ranking mafioso who was at the time running an Amsterdam coffee shop. Imperiale paid about €350,000 ($380,000; £305,000) for the paintings and his lawyers told the New York Times he had bought them because he was ""fond of art"" and they were a ""bargain"". Imperiale was among several suspected dealers arrested by Italian police last January. Another suspected dealer arrested at the same time reportedly told investigators the paintings were at Imperiale's house. The BBC's James Reynolds in Rome says mafia members are not known for their understated good taste and raids have often revealed a preference for ostentatious, kitsch decoration, so Imperiale was unlikely to have bought the paintings for display purposes. They were found wrapped in cloth in a safe in a house in the picturesque seaside town of Castellammare di Stabia, near Pompeii, last September. Van Gogh Museum Director Axel Ruger said it was wonderful to have the works back on display. ""I think it's one of the most joyous days in my career really,"" he said. The museum has not made any comment on the upcoming documentary, Trouw said. Why are the paintings significant? Vincent Van Gogh (1853-1890) is widely considered the greatest Dutch artist after Rembrandt. Seascape at Scheveningen was one of only two seascapes he painted while he lived in the Netherlands. It shows a foaming, stormy sea and thundery sky, and was painted in 1882 while he was staying in The Hague. Congregation Leaving the Reformed Church at Nuenen (1884) was painted for Van Gogh's mother, but also partly for his father, who had become a pastor at the church in 1882. When his father died in 1884, Van Gogh added churchgoers, including a few women wearing shawls used for mourning. Van Gogh committed suicide in France in 1890. Recovering stolen masterpieces The 2002 Van Gogh museum raid was one of a series of thefts that shocked the art world. In 2004, two Edvard Munch masterpieces, The Scream and Madonna, were seized by armed men who raided the Munch museum in Oslo. Several men were jailed and the paintings later recovered after painstaking detective work in 2006. Another version of The Scream was stolen from the National Art Museum in Oslo in 1994 and that too was later recovered in a sting operation by UK detectives. In 2012, seven artworks were stolen from Rotterdam's Kunsthal museum, including paintings by Picasso, Monet and Matisse. Two thieves were later jailed, telling a Bucharest court that security at the museum had been lax. Some of the paintings were destroyed in an oven. Earlier this year, four paintings out of a haul of 24 stolen from a Dutch gallery in 2005 were recovered in Ukraine.

There have already been calls for owner Ian Suttie to progress development plans for the site more quickly. Planning development management committee convener Ramsay Milne said: ""We said last week that we had concerns about health and safety at the Broadford Works site and the deterioration of the buildings. ""The terms of the Dangerous Buildings Notice should ensure that steps are taken as quickly as possible to make this site secure. ""There has been and continues to be a significant risk of serious injury and we want to do all we can to improve public safety. ""We are pleased that the site owner agreed to meet our building standards team today and is now co-operating fully with our requests to ensure the security of the perimeter of the site and the improvements required for public safety."" Warning signs The council said the 24-hour site security had to be in place by 9 June. Other measures, including the blocking of open lift shafts, and warning signs being erected, have to be completed by 29 June. Police have been called to Broadford Works 27 times since the start of the year. The figure was revealed in a letter from the force to Aberdeen Central MSP Kevin Stewart.

They argue he misled the electorate over a memo claiming SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon would rather have seen David Cameron become prime minister. The case is due in court next month with more than £60,000 already raised but now more is being sought. Mr Carmichael had initially denied leaking the confidential memo to the Daily Telegraph. He said that the first he had heard of it was when he received a phone call from a journalist. The MP later admitted full responsibility for sanctioning its release, and accepted that the ""details of the account are not correct"". The official cabinet office inquiry into the leaking of the memo found that Mr Carmichael had given permission to his former special adviser Euan Roddin to hand details of the memo to the newspaper. Campaigners raised £60,000 in crowd-funding to lodge the legal challenge to his election under the Representation of the People Act 1983.

input: Experts Eddie Playfair and Catherine Sezen, senior policy managers at the at the Association of Colleges, are answering them for you. You can send them a question using the form at the bottom of the page. Won't this massive grade inflation cause horrendous problems for Year 12s and Year 10s (if not earlier year groups) who can't possibly hope to compete with this hyper-inflation? Sid Fletcher, Midlands In such an unusual year it was going to be difficult to decide upon the best course of action to support this year's students. After all the twists and turns in the past week or so, at least most students now have grades which they can use to progress, which has to be key after all the uncertainty. This year's students will all be in line with their peers, as were last year's students and, we anticipate, next year's students. Will the GCSE maths grade I was emailed by my college be my final exam result, or will it change again? I am confused by all the information going round at the moment. Rebecca Gower, Essex The result you received this morning should have been the college centre assessed grade (CAG), or the exam board calculated grade - whichever is higher - and should be the final grade you will receive. If you have any questions about it the best thing is to speak to your college to double check. I am sure they will be able to help. My daughter is still waiting for Level 3 BTec results originally due last Thursday. When she does get them will they have been re-graded with the Level 1 & 2 or will she have to appeal (if needs be)? Sarah Martin, Surrey BTecs are going to be reviewed as a matter of course, so your daughter won't need to appeal. This might mean that her results are delayed for a little longer. I would suggest contacting her school or college to see if they have an update. My daughter failed her maths GCSE, but had no permanent teacher, so several teachers assessed her grades. Can GCSE results be based on mocks in this sort of case? Beth The best thing to do is for your daughter to speak to the college and explain her concerns. Students are no longer able to use their mock grades to appeal, as this information would have been taken into account in the CAG [the predicted grade awarded by their teacher]. Can I re-sit one particular subject on my own, or do I have to go via my school? Roj The advice for students who took exams at school is that you should sit the exam at that school, unless you have progressed to college and wish to take English and maths because you got a grade 3 or below. Speak to your school or local college. If you have the grades you need to progress to your next step, you may not need to sit autumn exams. If I get a lower grade while resitting, will I retain the previous (higher) grade? Anon The guidance is that the higher grade of the two will be the official result. My mock results show I could have got amazing GCSE results instead of the ones I've been given. Is it worth taking the exams even though I have my sixth-form place? Anon, Newbury If you have got the place you were hoping for then I would speak to your school or college about whether they advise that you consider taking exams in the autumn. You will be busy focusing on your new courses in the autumn and it might be better to concentrate on those. I learned I had not met the criteria to move forward into a BTec Level 2 engineering course a week before the results were due to come out. How can this happen? Anon, Lincoln College I would suggest that you speak to your college and ask them about the next best steps for you. They will be best placed to advise you. My son has learning difficulties and is on the ASD spectrum. He would have had a scribe if he had sat his GCSEs, but his grade assessment does not factor this in. What help is available for him? Anoop Centre assessed grades should have taken into consideration your son's learning difficulties and the fact that he would have had additional support. He will be able to take his GCSEs in the autumn if he wishes to do so at his school, but he may well have the grades he needs to progress to his next steps. Why do we have to wait for our BTec results while others don't? Anon, Blackpool The decision was taken late on Wednesday to review BTec grades in much the same way as has been done for GCSEs and A-levels in order to ensure that no student is disadvantaged. I appreciate this is disappointing, but hopefully you should receive your grades very shortly, and will know that they have been double-checked to make sure that you get the result you deserve. What is the appeal process going to be like for GCSE students who are let down by their centre assessed grades? Janet Kalambo The re-issued Ofqual student appeals guidance says it is felt that teachers know their students best. Therefore students can't appeal simply because they disagree with the CAG unless they suspect malpractice, including bias, or an administrative error. One thing to remember is that all schools and college have their own quality assurance processes, so it is not just an individual teacher making these important decisions. Teachers will have graded and ranked students and then this will have been moderated at department level and signed off by a senior leader. If a student has any concerns, the school or college will be able to advise on next steps. IGCSE results appear to still be based on algorithms, creating a disparity in the evaluation of different students' efforts. So how can there be an even playing field in the approach to their assessments? Ian, Rotherham Cambridge International, which awards IGCSEs, has confirmed that the process for these qualifications will be in line with that for GCSEs and use the grades that schools submitted, unless the grade issued by the exam board was higher. You can find further information here. If you have completed the practical part of a GCSE - like drama or food tech - will this be considered for your final grade? Nikki Bell, Barnet Students will receive the CAG unless the calculated (algorithm) grade was higher. Schools and colleges will have used a variety of evidence to arrive at centre assessed grade, including practical components. Why is it not possible for GCSE students to resit exams this autumn? Umar, Bolton GCSE students will be able to sit exams in autumn 2020. Hopefully though, your results will be what you need to progress to your next course and you might decide that there is no need to take an autumn exam. Your school or college will be able to advise you. If a student's calculated grades were higher than the CAG, which will be used for their GCSE results? Alisa, Purley Good question. The situation is the same as for A-levels. Students will receive a CAG unless the calculated result is higher, in which case they will receive the calculated result. When applying to university in two years' time, will my GCSEs have the same weight they may have had in other years? Adham, Warrington Universities will be aware of the challenges faced by Year 11 students this year. I am sure that when the time comes they will be mindful of this. Are there any safeguards for A-levels and GCSEs taking place in 2021, as students will be at a disadvantage from missing in-school teaching? Shamimur Rahman, Barking The exam regulator, Ofqual, is already considering plans for next year for all qualifications, GCSEs, A-levels and vocational technical qualifications. You can find out more about A-levels and GCSEs next year here. Is there any obligation on my son's grammar school to let him do a retake if he misses the required grade in one subject? Anon, Tring First of all I hope your son gets the grades he needs. Once he has received his results, the best thing to do is to speak to staff at the school who will be able to advise on next steps and the autumn exams if indeed he needs to take them.

Now complete the following example-
input: Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent Sanger was on an 18-city trip to India, speaking with doctors and activists about birth control and the liberation of women. Her fascinating exchange with Gandhi at his ashram in the western state of Maharashtra is part of a new biography of India's ""father of the nation"" by historian Ramachandra Guha. Drawing on never-before-seen sources from 60 different collections around the world, the 1,129-page book tells the dramatic story of the life of the world's most famous pacifist from the time he returned to India from South Africa in 1915, to his assassination in 1948. The biography also provides a glimpse into Gandhi's views on women's rights, sex and celibacy. In his ashram, Gandhi's efficient secretary, Mahadev Desai, took copious notes of the meeting between the leader and the activist. ""Both seem to be agreed that women should be emancipated, that a woman should be the arbiter of her destiny,"" he wrote. But differences quickly arose between the two. Mrs Sanger, who had opened the first US family planning centre in New York in 1916, believed that contraceptives were the safest route to emancipation. Gandhi demurred, saying women should resist their husbands, while men should try to curb ""animal passion"". He told his visitor that sex should be only for procreation. Mrs Sanger soldiered on spiritedly. She told Gandhi that ""women have feelings as deep as and as amorous as men. There are times when wives desire physical union as much as their husbands"". ""Do you think that it is possible for two people who are in love, who are happy together, to regulate their sex act only once in two years, so that their relationship would only take place when they wanted a child?"" she asked. This is where contraception came in handy, she insisted, and helped women prevent unwanted pregnancies and gain control over their bodies. Gandhi remained stubborn in his opposition. He told Sanger that he regarded all sex as ""lust"". He told her of his own marriage, saying the relationship with his wife, Kasturba, had become ""spiritual"" after he ""bade goodbye to a life of carnal pleasure"". Gandhi had married at 13, and taken a vow of celibacy when he was 38 and the father of four children. In doing so, he had been inspired by a Jain seer named Raychandbhai and Russian writer Leo Tolstoy, who became celibate in his later life. (Jainism is an ancient Indian religion of harmlessness and renunciation.) In his autobiography, Gandhi had written how guilt ridden he was by the thought that he was having sex with his wife when his father passed away. At the end of the conversation with Sanger, Gandhi relented a little. He said he didn't mind ""voluntary sterilisation in the case of man, since he is the aggressor"", and that instead of using contraceptives, couples could have sex during the ""safe period"" of the menstrual cycle. Mrs Sanger left the ashram unconvinced. Later, she wrote of Gandhi's ""appalling fear of licentiousness and over-indulgence"". She was deeply disappointed at his failure to endorse her campaign. It was not the first time that Gandhi had spoken out openly against artificial birth control. In 1934, an Indian women's rights activist had asked him whether contraceptives were the next best thing to ""self-control"". ""Do you think that the freedom of the body is obtained by resorting to contraceptives? Women should learn to resist their husbands. If contraceptives were resorted to as in the West, frightful results will follow. Men and women will be living for sex alone. They will become soft-brained, unhinged, in fact mental and moral wrecks,"" Gandhi had replied. ""For Gandhi, all sex was lust; sex was necessary for procreation. Modern methods of birth control legitimised lust. Far better that women resist men, and men control and tame their animal passions,"" writes Guha, his latest biographer, in his book Gandhi: The Years That Changed the World, 1914-1948. Many years later, as Hindu-Muslims riots rocked the southern Noakhali district of the state of Bengal on the eve of India's independence, Gandhi undertook a controversial experiment. He asked his grandniece and ardent devotee, Manu Gandhi, to join him in the bed he slept in. ""He was seeking to test, or further test, his conquest of sexual desire,"" Guha writes. Somehow, according to his biographer, Gandhi felt that the ""rise of religious violence was connected to his own failure to become a perfect brahmachari [celibate]"". Gandhi, who campaigned all his life for interfaith harmony, was appalled by the violence breaking out between Hindus and Muslims in the run up to independence from Britain. ""The connection was a leap of faith, an abdication of reason and perhaps also an expression of egotism. He had come round to the view that the violence around him was in part a product or consequence of the imperfections within him,"" Guha writes. Gandhi faced a lot of opposition when he told his associates about the ""experiment"". They warned him it would soil his reputation and that he should abandon it. One associate said it was both ""puzzling and indefensible"". Another quit working with Gandhi in protest. Guha writes that one needs to look beyond ""rationalist or instrumental explanations of why men behave as they do"" to understand this strange experiment. For some 40 years by then, Gandhi had been obsessed with celibacy. ""Now at the end of his own life, with his dream of an united India in ruins, Gandhi was attributing the imperfections of society to the imperfections of the society's most influential leader, namely himself"". A close associate and admirer of Gandhi later wrote to a friend that from a study of the leader's writings, he found that he ""represented a hard, puritanical form of self-discipline, something which we usually associate with medieval Christian ascetics or Jain recluses"". Historian Patrick French has written that although some of Gandhi's unconventional ideas were rooted in ancient Hindu philosophy, ""he was more tellingly a figure of the late Victorian age, both in his puritanism, and in his kooky theories about health, diet and communal living"". Clearly, Gandhi's attitudes to women were complex and contradictory. He appeared to be averse to women making themselves more attractive to men. He, according to Guha, abhorred ""modern hairstyles and clothes"". ""What a pity,"" he wrote to Manu Gandhi, ""that the modern girl attaches greater importance to following the code of fashion than to the protection of her health and strength."" He was also critical of the veil for Muslim women, saying it ""harms women's health, they can't get sufficient air and light and they remain disease-ridden."" At the same time, Gandhi believed in the rights of women, and that women were to be fully equal to men. In South Africa, women joined his political and social movements. He appointed a woman, Sarojini Naidu, to lead the Congress party at a time when political parties in the West had few women leaders. He asked women to protest outside liquor shops. Many women participated in the massive march to protest against the British salt monopoly and the salt tax. ""Gandhi,"" writes Guha, ""did not use the language of modern feminism. ""While strongly supportive of women's education, and open to women working in offices and factories, he thought the burden of child-rearing and homemaking should be borne by women. By the standards of our time, Gandhi should be considered conservative. By the standards of his own time, however, he was undoubtedly progressive."" When India became independent in 1947, this legacy, believes Guha, helped the country get a woman governor and a woman cabinet minister. The work of rehabilitating millions of refugees was led by a group of powerful women. A top university chose a woman as a vice-chancellor, decades before top American universities began choosing women presidents. Women, says Guha, were as prominent in public life in the India of the 1940s and 1950s as in the US of the same period. This must count as one of Gandhi's important, and not so well known achievements, despite his eccentric ""experiments with truth"".

input: But less than 17% of biographies on Wikipedia and less than 10% of entries in the Dictionary of Welsh Biography (DWB) are about women. On Thursday, some of Wales' most influential women will take part in a 12-hour edit-a-thon in a bid to close the gender gap. Marion Loffler of the DWB said many were ""hidden away"" in men's entries. The global edit-a-thon, a joint project between the BBC and Wikipedia, will see people from all over the world creating profiles for their heroines to mark the end of this year's Women 100 campaign. As it happened:Women take over Wikipedia While Wikipedia is one of the most popular websites in the world, only about 15% of its editors are women, and less than 17% of biographies are of women, according to the site. John Lubbock, media spokesman for Wikipedia UK, said the lack of female profiles reflected the division in wider society. ""We rely on society to put reliable facts in, and a lot of those facts dating back about 60 or 70 years ago would have been produced for and about men,"" he said. ""We look more western, more white, more male: we really want to create a world where these divisions are much less obvious."" Nine Welsh women from business, television, politics and sport will add and create new profiles for the women who have inspired them at an event at BBC Wales' HQ in Llandaff. Co-founder of the Hang Fire Smokehouse, Cardiff, Shauna Guinn, will edit the profile of singer Cerys Matthews, while one of the stars of the 2013 Great British Bake Off, Beca Lyne-Pirkis, from Penylan in Cardiff, will edit composer Grace Williams' profile. '200 women missing' Assistant editor of the DWB Marion Loffler said the national archive ""urgently"" needed articles on hundreds of women. While progress has been made, less than 10% of biographies on the site are about women - at least 200 women are missing. ""Some entries written early on, like that on Betsi Cadwaladr, are very much of their time and urgently need thorough revision,"" she said. ""Other women, such as the pioneering industrialist and feminist novelist Amy Dillwyn, are not there at all. ""Some, such as the influential cultural patron Lady Augusta Hall (Lady Llanover) are hidden away in their husbands' or fathers' entries,"" she said. Five influential Welsh women not on Wikipedia: Betty Campbell MBE Wales' first black head teacher, Mrs Campbell led Mount Stuart Primary in Butetown, Cardiff, for almost 30 years. The great grandmother was awarded an MBE in 2003 for services to education and community life. On Thursday, BBC Wales' Felicity Evans will create her profile on Wikipedia. The first Welsh woman to climb to the summit of Mount Everest, Tori James battled -40C temperatures and crippling illness to make history. In 2007, the then 25-year-old from Pembrokeshire also became the youngest woman from the UK to reach the 29,030ft (8,850m) Himalayan summit. Ms James was also a member of the Pink Lady Polecats - the first team of women to complete the Polar challenge, a 360-mile (579km) race to the North Pole. But when you search for her name in Wikipedia, it asks ""did you mean: Toni James?"". Cpt Winterbourne, from Cardiff, is the Army's highest ranking transgender officer. In charge of 100 soldiers, she decided to transition while serving in Afghanistan and started the process in 2013. To help others like her, Hannah became an ambassador for LGB&T Sport Cymru. The BBC Wales picture editor wrote and presented two Before I Kick the Bucket documentaries about living with cancer. The 40-year-old, from Cardiff, died from breast cancer in September, seven years after she was first diagnosed. In the months before she died, Ms Kincaid - who defied the doctors telling her she would never see her 40th birthday - wrote a letter to her cancer, telling the disease she would not go down without a fight. The international hockey player, from Penarth, become the first LGBT Sport Cymru ambassador in 2014 and is on Welsh Cycling's board of directors. The Swansea Spartans player told BBC Wales News young women should never be afraid to be their true selves. ""Never accept being told you cannot achieve something - most importantly always try to be kind,"" she said. Which woman inspires you? Every year BBC 100 Women names 100 influential and inspirational women around the world, creating documentaries, features and interviews about their lives. On Thursday, anyone can take part in the edit-a-thon event from their computer at home or at work - watch the video below to understand how.

input: By Alice CuddyBBC News It was August 1991 and the man's chest bore several stab wounds. The local workers who found him told police it was the stench that led them to his corpse. The discovery marked the beginning of a decades-long mystery in the Netherlands, with police unable to identify the victim, much less find the person responsible. But the truth could now finally be in sight after Dutch police launched their first-ever podcast aimed at solving a crime. True crime podcasts are nothing new, but for police in the Netherlands this was an unprecedented venture. Thousands tuned in to the three-part series when it aired last month and tip-offs have been coming in ever since. It began with the body in the blanket When police arrived at the scene, they searched the corpse for any trace of the man's identity. There was no ID and decomposition had rendered his body unrecognisable. Johan Baas had recently been appointed as a detective in the city of Naarden when the body was found. ""I was on vacation leave for a few days when my boss called me and informed me about the discovery of the body,"" he recalled. ""It was my first major case, so the choice was clear. I went straight to the crime scene."" Mr Baas remembers it vividly. ""The body was minutely dissected and everything was recorded photographically and in writing,"" he said. During the 1990s, Dutch police estimate that about 90% of all murders were solved. But DNA technology was still in its infancy and resources were limited, so the case was harder to crack than it might be today. Large amounts of blood or sperm were needed to find an offender and there was no DNA database. ""We had to make do with existing means such as fingerprints, but the victim's prints did not appear in the Dutch database and we did not progress further internationally,"" said the detective. Looking for clues No witnesses came forward and police had no picture to hand out because of the condition of the corpse. Efforts to analyse his clothes bore no results and the electric blanket, produced in Germany in the 1960s, was sold by the thousands in the Netherlands, Belgium and France. Any hope of solving the crime hinged on a gold ring found on one of the victim's fingers. Detectives discovered that it was bought through a mail order company called Otto and began tracking down the buyers. Most still had the ring in their possession but one man said he did not have it anymore because he had sold it to a man at a bar in Amsterdam. Witnesses confirmed the sale and said the buyer went to the same bar almost every day. However, the mysterious character, believed to be Turkish, had not been seen in weeks and police never discovered who he was or if it was his body that had been found. In Johan Baas's later investigations it was always clear who was the victim and who was the perpetrator. But police had hit a stumbling block and the case was ultimately dropped. How the podcast began Police reopened the case a couple of years ago, using new technology to analyse the body and carry out a facial reconstruction of the victim. They discovered that the man would have been around 65 years old in 1991 and came from Eastern Europe. Unable to crack the case alone, last month they opened the case to the public for the first time, with a podcast (in Dutch). Listeners across the Netherlands tuned in and came forward each day with information that may be relevant to the case. Police said they could not give details of the tip-offs they had received but several had contained useful information. ""Our first goal is to identify the victim and tell his relatives after 28 years what happened,"" said Rob Boon, coordinator of the police Cold Case team who led the podcast. ""Our second goal is to find the killer and bring him or her to court."" Can podcasts work? Criminologist David Wilson said it was natural for Dutch police to want to capitalise on the popularity of true crime podcasts and pass on details of crimes and unsolved cases. ""True crime is incredibly popular and the police are as aware of this as any other individual, group or industry,"" he said. But police podcasts have their limitations, as there are some areas they cannot touch, because of laws on what they can say so as not to prejudice any future case. ""The podcaster can suggest things that the police might not be able to suggest. They can raise possibilities that the police wouldn't be able to raise,"" he added. Even so, numerous cases have been solved by police crime appeal programmes such as the UK's Crimewatch and its Dutch TV equivalent, and Mr Wilson is confident podcasting will probably bring the same results. Johan Baas is no longer on the case but the detective sent to the crime scene in 1991 believes there is a chance the victim can be identified. No names have emerged so far and Mr Baas says the man's family need to know. ""I know what impact a loss has on those left behind. Of course you want to arrest a suspect as a detective, but unfortunately it never came to that."" You might also like: True crime podcast helps woman find her brother's grave

input: By Russell HottenBusiness reporter, BBC News The social media firms's latest UK accounts show that profits last year jumped by 54% to £96.6m. Facebook's total tax charge on those profits almost doubled to £30.4m, but was reduced due to adjustments. Tax campaigner and MP Margaret Hodge said such a low bill was ""outrageous"", but Facebook said it pays what it owes. Gross revenues from advertising and other activities rose 30% in 2018, a year when the Cambridge Analytica affair was at its height and the company was facing heavy criticism. The UK division spent £356m on research, development and engineering in the UK last year, the accounts filed at Companies House showed. Steve Hatch, the company's vice president for Northern Europe, said: ""The UK is now one of Facebook's most important hubs for global innovation. We continue to grow and invest heavily in the UK and by the end of the year we'll employ 3,000 people here. ""Businesses across the country use our platforms to grow and revenue from customers supported by our UK teams is now recorded here so that any taxable profit is subject to UK corporation tax."" Facebook said it complies with tax laws in all jurisdictions and pays what is legally due. But Ms Hodge, a former chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, and who now leads an all-party parliamentary group looking into the tax system, tweeted that it was ""still outrageous"" that big tech firms were not paying their fair share into society. Last month, Amazon came under fire for paying £14.7m in UK corporation tax last year, despite reporting sales of £2.3bn. Google has faced similar criticism. Earlier this week, the Organisation for Economic and Development (OECD), proposed tax changes aimed at making global firms pay more tax. The proposals would give governments more power specifically to tax big technology firms such as Apple, Facebook and Google. Companies that do business in more than one country have long been a challenge for tax authorities, because they can structure their business in a way that minimises their tax bills. The OECD's proposal includes new rules on where tax should be paid and on the proportion of their profits that should be taxed in each country.

input: Paladin aims to help victims by developing a co-ordinated community response to stalking. It intends to campaign for restraining orders to be more effective, for statutory rights for victims and to urge a review of how family courts operate. Its directors were among those who campaigned for a new stalking law. Stalking became a specific criminal offence in England and Wales in November last year when the government introduced two offences - stalking and stalking involving a fear of violence. The establishment of a national victims' advocacy scheme was a recommendation from the Independent Parliamentary Inquiry into Stalking Law Reform in February 2012. In Scotland stalking was made an offence in 2010. 'Best protection' Paladin's co-director Harry Fletcher, also the assistant general secretary of probation union Napo, said the advocacy group will risk assess the situation, liaise with police, the Probation Service, and the Crown Prosecution Service. ""We will actually intervene on [the victim's] behalf as well so we have got very, very good relationships already with the Police Federation and with individual police services. ""They need training desperately and we will assist with that as well."" The Association of Chief Police Officers welcomed Paladin, saying it would offer valuable support. Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan, Acpo's national policing lead on stalking and harassment, said: ""The police service absolutely recognises the seriousness of stalking. ""The best way to protect victims of stalking is to use available legislation - especially the new offences of stalking - and to prosecute perpetrators. I hope that the launch of this service will signpost victims to report their concerns to the police in order to offer the best protection."" Mr Fletcher said that restraining orders needed to be strengthened and there needed to be a ""thorough review of the family courts to prevent perpetrators from making vexatious applications for contact with their children when there is no hope of it being granted."" 'Unbelievable' stalking Co-director Laura Richards also called for training of all criminal justice professionals so ""that stalking behaviour, which can maim and take lives, is taken more seriously"". Sam Taylor, a victim of stalking over a four-year period, described on BBC Radio 4's Today programme how her relationship broke down when she discovered her partner was on the sex offenders register for raping a 14-year-old girl. During the stalking, she said he was arrested on many occasions, released on bailed or with restraining orders, and spent some time in custody. Asked how intense the stalking was, she said: ""It was just unbelievable."" She said it consisted of ""endless phone calls"", texts, including one which included an image of a noose, breaking into her house, and leaving his vehicle outside her parents' house for days. ""Initially I didn't know I was being stalked, I just knew I was terrified. Part of me was reluctant to go to police because I didn't want to get him into trouble."" But once she realised that this behaviour could be regarded as stalking, and she realised was at risk, she reported it to police. Other help for stalking victims already exists, including the National Stalking Helpline, as well as domestic violence charities.

input: Carles Puigdemont fled to Belgium days after the region's abortive declaration of independence from Spain in October and was eventually arrested in Germany. The German court approved his extradition to face Spanish charges of misuse of public funds but not the graver charge of rebellion. German prosecutors must now decide on whether he will be handed over. They have already indicated they will extradite him. Mr Puigdemont pledged: ""We will fight until the end, and we will win!"" He described the decision of the court not to endorse the more serious charge of rebellion as a victory, saying he had ""defeated the main lie"" of the Spanish state. What is he doing in Germany? He was arrested in Schleswig-Holstein, northern Germany, in March on a European Arrest Warrant after crossing the Danish border on his way back to Belgium by car from a visit to Finland. Bailed in April, he has frequently been reported to be in Berlin, and his Twitter profile lists his location as Hamburg. Mr Puigdemont's legal team told Reuters news agency he would appeal against any extradition decision. If Thursday's decision stands, Spain's courts will be unable to put him on trial for rebellion against the government, a charge faced by fellow separatists. While the charge of rebellion carries a sentence of up to 25 years, the maximum sentence for misuse of public funds is eight. Why is he so important? Catalonia is a semi-autonomous region of Spain with a long history and a distinct cultural identity. As its regional president, Mr Puigdemont was the central figure in the 1 October vote which saw 90% vote for independence - but with a turnout of just 43%. Madrid refused to accept the result, leading to a major political crisis. More than three weeks later, the Catalan parliament formally declared independence. Spain's government instituted direct rule over the region, fired its leaders and called snap elections. Charges of rebellion against independence leaders followed, prompting Mr Puigdemont's self-imposed exile to Belgium. Nine of his colleagues remain in prison in Spain facing similar charges. After Thursday's ruling, Mr Puigdemont tweeted: ""Every minute that our companions spend in prison is a minute of shame and injustice."" Has anything changed in Spain? Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez - who has been more open to dialogue on Catalonia than his predecessor Mariano Rajoy - said Spain respected the German court's judgement. But equally, he said, those involved in the independence campaign ""must be judged by the Spanish courts."" ""This will not be resolved in a day, two months or five months,"" he said, adding that ""much dedication"" and patience would be needed to deal with Catalonia's situation. In Catalonia, direct rule from Madrid was only lifted last month, with Mr Puigdemont stepping aside as leader in favour of a close ally, Quim Torra. Mr Torra has declared his regional government will continue to pursue independence for a Catalan republic.

input: Three gang members were killed and two injured in the clash, police say. Earlier on Monday about 50 men moved into the Paraguayan city of Ciudad del Este, blew up the front of a private security firm, and fired on police. Unconfirmed reports suggest they could have stolen up to $40m (£31m; €37m). After the robbery, the gang created a diversion by burning cars and attacking the local police station. They escaped after a two-hour shootout that left one police officer dead at the scene after the company's vaults were blown up. Police believe they fled in several of the security company's armoured trucks and then may have transferred their booty to waiting boats at the Parana river. They were believed to have travelled 50km (30 miles) downriver to a region called Itaipulandia in Brazil, were they were intercepted by Brazilian police. Brazilian federal police came across 12 men who exchanged fire and then escaped, Brazilian Globo website reported. The men left guns, ammunition, flack jackets and explosives in the car they abandoned, police said. A large security operation is under way to try to recapture the gang on both sides of the border.

input: Warner Bros also announced that Peter Jackson, who directed the Oscar-winning Lord of the Rings trilogy, would direct the two-part prequel. The films, based on JRR Tolkien's book, had been delayed for months due to MGM Studios' - which owns half the project - ongoing financial woes. No release dates for the movies have been given. According to industry paper Hollywood Reporter, Warner Bros and MGM reached a deal allowing MGM to cover its half of the production, estimated to cost a total of $500m (£313m). Jackson, who co-wrote the screenplays and is also producing the films, originally hired Mexican-born Guillermo Del Toro to direct, but he pulled out in June citing almost two years of delays. Last month, the project was threatened further after Jackson warned production could cease or be moved from its location in New Zealand over a pay wrangle with acting unions. The two movies will be shot back to back using digital 3D cameras. In a statement, Jackson said: ""Exploring Tolkien's Middle-earth goes way beyond a normal film-making experience. ""It's an all-immersive journey into a very special place of imagination, beauty and drama. We're looking forward to re-entering this wondrous world with Gandalf and Bilbo."" The Lord of the Rings trilogy grossed nearly $3bn (£1.88bn) at box offices worldwide and in 2003 the final chapter, Return of the King, dominated the Oscars, winning in all of the 11 categories in which it was nominated, including best film.

One key scene featured more than 6,000 extras on the seafront, which Boyle said helped ""build a relationship with the local community"". ""The film benefits and the local community benefits because you are giving something back,"" he said. Other scenes from Yesterday were shot at the Latitude Festival and Halesworth in Suffolk, and at Clacton-on-Sea in Essex. Screen Suffolk, which promotes the region to film-makers and champions local talent, has predicted an increase in ""film-induced tourism"" to all the locations featured. As well as bringing money to the town during the shoot, Boyle said he hoped the experience of taking part had been one ""people will value"". The film was given its regional premiere on Friday, with a screening at the Gorleston Palace cinema. The film imagines a world without The Beatles, in which struggling singer-songwriter Jack Malik is able to pass off the Fab Four's songs as his own. One of his breakthrough performances comes on the roof of the Pier Hotel in Gorleston, in an echo of The Beatles's famous Savile Row rooftop concert. ""When you see this scene of the concert... 6,428 good people from Gorleston and the surrounds turned up for our concert and we had a great day,"" said Boyle. The film is seen as an opportunity to showcase East Anglia as a film-making destination. Its star, Himesh Patel, who grew up in Cambridgeshire, has said he enjoyed discovering ""home turf I'd not really explored"" during filming.

input: By Orla GuerinBBC News, Cairo The relatives who departed with her are believed to be among about 500 people who drowned when traffickers rammed their boat. Survivors say the migrants had refused to transfer to a smaller ship, fearing it was less sea-worthy. Traffickers ended the argument by sinking their vessel. For the Bakr family - who are Palestinians - this was the second catastrophe in recent years. Hamas drove them from Gaza in 2007 and seized their business interests. They settled in Egypt but faced many problems so - for the first time - some turned to the traffickers. ""I was completely against it but they kept saying there was no future here, or back home in Gaza,"" said Atef Bakr, a family elder who stayed behind. ""They had this dream to get to Europe and to have a decent life for themselves and their children."" Mr Bakr, a former colonel in the Palestinian security forces, has the slow speech and reddened eyes of a man crushed by grief. These days he spends his time searching for updates about the disaster and mourning almost two dozen relatives, including his brother, his son and his grandson. His mother, Amina, sat alongside in a white headscarf, recalling better days in Gaza. ""We used to eat together, drink together, do everything together. We hope to God to be reunited one day. We hope to hear that they are all right,"" she said, before giving way to tears. In a bitter irony, most of the dead were strong swimmers as the family were fishermen. ""They used to swim in the sea in all seasons,"" said Mr Bakr. ""They could deal with rough seas and cold water. They were still young. How could they drown?"" The Bakrs set sail from Damietta in northern Egypt where people smuggling is a growth industry. There are said to be about 20 departure points along the coast. ""Last year trafficking wasn't organised but now the gangs are getting connected with each other and the business is getting bigger,"" said Muhammed Al Kashef, a researcher for the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR). ""The traffickers now have more money and more power,"" he said. ""By next year it will be hard to tackle them."" Mr Al Kashef, who advocates on behalf of migrants and monitors traffickers, says Palestinians, Egyptians, Libyans and Syrians are now involved in the trade. The key traffickers and brokers are shadowy figures known only by nicknames like Abu Hamada (also called the Doctor and the Captain), and the General. Migrants pay at least $2,000 (£1,200) and sometimes up to $4,000 per person, depending on the condition of the boat. The traffickers operate from public places - including harbours alongside tourist beaches - when the coast is clear. Mr Al Kashef says they work between dawn and 5pm to avoid coastguard patrols at night. When migrants arrive at the departure point they are put on fishing boats that ferry them out to larger vessels in international waters. They spend two to three days there waiting for the boat to be filled with hundreds of migrants. When the ship is packed they begin the voyage to Italy. They are transferred en-route to another vessel that brings them to Italian territorial waters. The traffickers then phone an SOS to the coastguard and dump the migrants in the sea. More than 3,000 have drowned in the Mediterranean this year, according to the International Organisation for Migration. But the European Border Agency, Frontex, says a record number - 182,156 - have made it to Europe by sea. That is three times the total for 2013. The dramatic increase in arrivals has prompted European nations to plan their biggest ever exercise to detect migrants. Operation Triton, which will involve more than 20 European countries, is due to begin on 1 November. But the focus will be on border control, not search and rescue. Aid agencies fear that more migrants will now die at sea. 'Panic and exhaustion' Abu Baraa, a father of five, knows the perils of the voyage to Europe only too well. The Syrian refugee, who asked us not to use his full name, has already tried the journey 10 times. In April he was stranded at sea for a week with his wife and children. ""There were 160 Syrians on the boat and 64 Egyptians,"" he said. ""On the third day they told us there was no more water, so we started drinking sea water. It was hot during the day and cold at night. My children became terrified of the sea. Words can't describe the panic and exhaustion and hunger. Those seven days were like seven years."" They wound up back in Egypt after the traffickers had a row between themselves over money. ""Another boat was chasing us and trying to drown us,"" Abu Baraa said. ""The captain on our boat was very courageous and sailed back to the shore very quickly."" His wife and children finally made it to Europe in July but he couldn't afford to go with them. He proudly shows me a photograph of his four-year-old daughter Farah, clutching yellow balloons, on her first day at school in Germany. ""I can't say I'm not afraid of the crossing but if I get the money, I'm going to try again,"" he said. ""They are in one place and I am in another. I am like a body without a soul."" Single conviction If Abu Baraa makes another attempt, drowning is not the only risk he will face. He could be detained by Egyptian police as he tries to board the boat. More than 4,300 migrants have been arrested so far this year trying to leave the country, according to the Egyptian Initiative for Personal rights. This includes eight members of the Bakr family - four of them children - who were due to join their relatives on the ill-fated boat from Damietta. They spent six weeks in custody before being released. Campaigners here say the police are more focused on targeting migrants than those who prey on them. The authorities deny any collusion with bosses of the lucrative people smuggling trade. They admit that only one trafficker has been sentenced to jail in the past five years but say that is because the law is not tough enough.

input: By Jonathan HeadBBC South East Asia Correspondent First there was the young boy, apparently abandoned by the Australian couple who had commissioned a Thai surrogate mother to carry him. The boy had Down's syndrome, but the couple had taken his twin sister back to Australia with them. Then there were the 12 babies found living in a single apartment with nannies, all fathered by the same, mysterious young Japanese man. Many more babies had already been spirited out of Thailand. Today the Australian boy - named Gammy - lives with the woman who was paid to give birth to him, seemingly a loved member of his adopted family. ""I don't regret anything about the surrogacy"", Pattaramon Chanbua told me. ""I don't blame anyone. To me, Gammy is a blessing."" To help her cope with the strikingly fair-skinned little boy, an Australian charity has bought her a bigger house, and gives her a modest monthly allowance. Gammy has also been given Australian citizenship. Mitsutoki Shigeta, the mystery Japanese man, is still fighting to get custody of the 12 babies he sired through various Thai surrogates. They are being kept in a state children's shelter. Last month a court awarded him custody of three, despite strong concern over his motives for wanting so many babies. 'I'd do it again' Now, five years after it was first drafted, the Thai parliament has passed a law which it hopes will shut down the ""wombs-for-rent"" business for good. Foreigners are banned from seeking surrogates in Thailand. Thai couples can find surrogate parents, but not through agents, or on any kind of commercial basis. At the heart of the business are hard-up Thai women, who see nine months carrying someone else's child as a relatively easy way to make good money. Pattaramon was one, although she says she would never do it again. Daeng, a factory worker living outside Bangkok, is another. A single mother in her thirties, she agreed to carry twins for Mr Shigeta. When the time came to hand them over, she admitted it was hard. ""I carried them for nine months, and I loved them,"" she said. But she went through with the contract, and ""would do it again - so would anybody - because of the money"". Daeng says she was paid the equivalent of 10 years' salary. Other women have had unhappier surrogacy experiences. Four years ago, 15 Vietnamese women were found in a Bangkok apartment, seven of them pregnant. Some of them said they had been lured there with the promise of well-paid jobs; two said they had been raped. A Taiwanese company called Babe-101 was accused by anti-trafficking groups of being behind the operation, but the police never pressed charges, and the doctor who supervised the conceptions and the births is still practising at a well-known Bangkok hospital. Like much of Thailand's medical industry, the surrogacy business is profit-driven and poorly regulated. For childless couples, desperate for a family, this has meant quick and low-cost surrogacies, without too much red tape. Most would probably want the best possible treatment for the carrier of their children. But it does not always work out that way. At a women's shelter on the outskirts of Bangkok, I watched three figures, masked by balaclavas, nervously telling their story to journalists. One of them was Namphun - not her real name. Her husband was with her. Until that week, he had believed the baby she was carrying was his. But then, she said, he had been threatened by police officers, who insisted his wife had signed a contract to carry a baby for a Chinese man, and that she had to travel overseas for the birth. They both fled to seek refuge in the shelter, along with another pregnant surrogate. Namphun said she was terrified of the agent, who she said had also been putting pressure on her to leave Thailand before the expected crackdown on surrogates. She had decided she no longer wanted to go through with the deal - she would keep the baby, no matter that she had no genetic connection to it. ""If they stop chasing me, after the birth I will love it, and take care of it."" She showed me the contract. Surprisingly, the address of the company she was dealing with, IVF Sunrise, was in London. Its website shows an office in Bangkok, but when I visited last September, there was no sign of it, nor had anyone in the building heard of it. IVF Sunrise is listed as a limited liability partnership, with a correspondence address in Percy Street, London, but its partners are entities based in Belize and the Seychelles. A staff member responded to a BBC email by stating that the company now operates in Nepal, but has been out of Thailand since last September. The response did not address questions about how Namphun was treated. The surrogate business in Thailand has often been a shadowy, unaccountable one. Now the practice has been more or less outlawed, there are justified fears that, with so much money on offer, it will simply be driven underground. ""We have no law enforcement"", admits Dr Somsak Lolekha of the Thai Medical Council. ""Just like drinking and driving. We have the law. But they never enforce it. ""That is a weak point of Thailand.""

input: The Bank of Scotland's Second Steppers report found 61% of first-time sellers were unable to afford the deposit for their next house. Nearly a fifth of new home owners said they thought it was harder to move up the ladder than it was to get on it in the first place The bank said it showed the property market still posed ""tough challenges"". The report found the average deposit required by a second stepper last year was £37,057, four-times more than in 2002 (£9,053). Increased deposits It also suggested the average person trying to move to their second home has had their current property on the market for 13 months and would live in their first home for five and a half years, 18 months longer than new home owners did in 2011. Two-thirds (66%) of the respondents said the level of deposit required was the main barrier to arranging a mortgage, citing this as a key reason for not being able to buy a new home. Almost half had either lost some or all of the deposit they paid on their first property because of falling house prices. Laurence Mann, head of mortgages at Bank of Scotland, said: ""Despite recent improvements in the housing market, first-time sellers in Scotland continue to be faced with some very real and tough challenges when trying to make their next move on the property ladder. ""It is vital that this group of home movers receive more support and attention as they play an intrinsic role in getting the housing market moving again. ""To achieve a sustainable housing market in Scotland we need to see movement throughout the market."" He also warned: ""If second steppers get stuck on the first rung, movement at the bottom half of the ladder comes to a standstill, and this bottleneck will not only restrict the supply of starter properties but will have a knock-on effect across the whole of the housing market.""

input: The cash will enable a design team to be appointed and other fundraising to start, Culture Minister Fiona Hyslop said. Japanese architect Kengo Kuma will head up the team after winning the competition to design the £45m building, due to be opened in 2014. The museum will be sited at Craig Harbour on the banks of the River Tay. The V&A at Dundee is being built in collaboration with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Local partners in the project include the University of Dundee, the University of Abertay, Dundee City Council and Scottish Enterprise. 'Iconic building' Announcing the funding at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art & Design - part of Dundee University - the culture minister said: ""The V&A at Dundee will be great for the city as well as benefitting the whole of Scotland, acting as a magnet for visitors from all over the world. ""Scotland's strong and vibrant creative industries are a high growth sector which already employ more than 63,000 people and contribute more than £5.2bn to the Scottish economy annually. ""Alongside the city's very successful games sector, the V&A at Dundee presents quite an opportunity to grow Dundee's reputation as a centre for the creative industries sector."" Ms Hyslop said that the Scottish government's pledge provided a ""sound funding basis"" to which the partnership could add, creating an ""iconic building"" on the waterfront. Competition Professor Pete Downes, Principal of the University of Dundee, said the project would now progress at ""full speed"" in the year ahead. He added: ""It is particularly fitting that we are here in Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art & Design for this announcement today. ""The college's reputation for excellence is a significant part of what attracted the V&A to Dundee in the first place and contributing to the growth of creative industries is a major part of the university's future strategy."" Mr Kuma beat off competition from five other short-listed companies in November with his vision for the development. More than 120 firms took part in the competition to design the landmark building. The Japanese architect said the V&A at Dundee would combine the tradition and heritage of London's Victoria and Albert Museum with new ideas.

input: The helicopter was carrying seven people. Officials said there were no signs of survivors. A search for the final passenger would resume in the morning, depending on the weather, authorities added. Two of the passengers are believed to have been minors, the Coast Guard said. The aircraft was touring Kauai's rugged Napali coast when it encountered showers and high gusts of wind, the agency said. It was reported missing by the operator, identified as Safari Helicopters, at 18:06 on Thursday (04:06 GMT Friday), 40 minutes after it was due to land. Steep terrain, low visibility, choppy seas and rain hampered the search for the wreckage, the Coast Guard said. Petty Officer 1st Class Robert Cox, of the Coast Guard Joint Rescue Command Centre in Honolulu, said that weather conditions had been challenging. Winds on Friday were reported to be about 28mph (45km/h). No signals were recorded from the aircraft's electronic locator after it went missing. An MH-65 Dolphin helicopter and the Coast Guard Cutter William Hart took part in the search. Several tour companies make such helicopter visits to Kauai, much of which is a state park and which is 80% uninhabited. In April, a tour helicopter crashed into a residential neighbourhood in Kailua, 12 miles (19km) outside of Honolulu, killing all three people on board. Earlier in the month, a helicopter crash landed in the Sacred Falls State Park after suffering apparent engine failure.

input: By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics & Business Editor There have been long running campaigns to cut both taxes. A consultation on them formed part of the DUP's confidence and supply deal with the Conservatives in June 2017. The government's response has been published alongside the budget and said that for legal reasons no changes can be made until the UK has left the EU. Instead APD will be further examined by a ""technical working group"" while VAT will remain ""under review"". The government also suggests that ""level playing field"" provisions in any eventual deal with the EU may limit any changes to the taxes in Northern Ireland. It states: ""In the future, the government is committed to continuing the control of anti-competitive subsidies by creating a UK-wide subsidy control framework. ""This would include a commitment to maintain a common rulebook with the EU on state aid, enforced by the Competition and Markets Authority."" The government does concede that there ""may be scope"" to make VAT changes in the future but cautions that it is ""a complex area affecting important sources of revenue for the Exchequer which requires further exploration"". The government also takes a sceptical approach to the tourism VAT cut which was introduced in the Republic of Ireland during the economic downturn. A special low rate of 9% was introduced in 2011 as a temporary measure to help the industry in the depths of a recession. However, the government says the upsurge in the tourism industry there has ""reflected, to some extent, global economic recovery and that of Ireland"".

The Do Not Pay bot currently works in the UK and New York in the US. It asks a series of questions to determine the validity of a penalty notice. It can also be used to work out compensation for delayed flights. Mr Browder told the BBC he hoped it proved bots could be useful. ""Bots are a huge opportunity for public service,"" he said. ""I'm very surprised it has been so successful, but I am not surprised that so many people have pushed back against their parking tickets."" Of the 160,000 successful challenges, 9,000 were from New York, where the bot launched in March 2016, reports Venture Beat. Mr Browder was inspired to build the bot, which he describes as ""the world's first robot lawyer"", after receiving ""countless"" parking tickets himself. It took him three months to program. The Stanford University student is currently building a new bot aimed at helping Syrian refugees by producing English documents based on Arabic text. However, Abhi Chirimar, the chief executive of online mental health community Instawell, said that in his experience there was no chatbot ""silver bullet"" for companies offering digital services across more than one platform. ""Service developers need to be mindful of the pros and cons when designing chatbots,"" he said. ""Chatbots need tactical conversation design to ensure that the average person feels comfortable throughout the process. ""We realised early on that there isn't an easy 'silver-bullet' for our chatbot. ""Now, a Facebook user and a Slack user are served up different chatbots for the same goal - get the right kind of help.""

The study, funded by charity Trust for London and the Home Office, concluded that all areas of England and Wales needed services and strategies to meet the needs of FGM victims. Increasing awareness Dr Mwenya Chimba, Violence Against Women Director at Bawso, believes people are becoming more aware of FGM. She said: ""The FGM summit in London last year really raised the profile. ""We have been approached by women where it happened a long time ago and they require support psychologically. ""We are contacted by women who have undergone FGM themselves and fear if they return home their child would be at risk. ""We also work one-to-one with families when we feel a child could be at risk. We speak to mothers and fathers to try and raise awareness."" FGM, sometimes called female circumcision, refers to procedures including the partial or total removal of external female genital organs for non-medical reasons. It is illegal in the UK. The NHS says FGM is prevalent in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, and is carried out for ""cultural, religious and social reasons"".

I am finally using my brain properly,"" said Jac, from Llangennech near Llanelli. ""I can play and arrange lots of instruments using eye gaze."" The 22-year old has been studying music and film for the past three years and says his biggest influences are Gary Barlow, Michael Buble and Emma Bunton. He has gained 10 qualifications with Forget Me Not Productions, an organisation which specialises in making the arts accessible to all through the use of assistive technology. His debut single will be played at RawFfest - a youth arts festival for 14 to 25-year-olds - which is being held at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay this weekend. Jac said he was happy to be part of the festival and paid tribute to his teachers.

""I think people can expect to be impressed and entertained by my music.""

""With Jac he can't use his hands, he has no speech so he has this creativity locked inside of him,"" she explained. ""So what this eye gaze technology is doing is enabling him to express his love of music by being original and creative."" Ms Richards added: ""He loves all music and it has enriched his life and it makes him so happy, and that makes us happy.""

The US President then rowed back on his initial comments following criticism from a number of MPs. Asked about her response to President Trump's remarks as she gave evidence to the Assembly's Brexit committee on Monday, Ms Morgan said ""legally, it would be difficult for us to stop because we don't have a veto over trade"". ""Politically, I think it's extremely unlikely to happen,"" the international relations and the Welsh language minister said. ""They [the UK Government] should not be concluding any trade agreements without consulting us where we have the power."" Ms Morgan explained that UK and Welsh government officials are working on an agreement or 'concordat' for how future trade deals are negotiated. During a robust exchange, the Labour AM Alun Davies said: ""I want something which is in law to which I can hold you to account and which colleagues in Westminster can hold the UK Government to account.

Responding to the criticism, Ms Morgan said: ""Is the current intergovernmental structure adequate?

input: Mr Trump told the New York Times the actions of Mr Sessions had been ""very unfair to the president"". Mr Sessions recused himself after admitting meeting Russia's ambassador. He said on Thursday he would not resign and he would continue running the Justice Department effectively. ""I plan to continue to do so as long as that is appropriate,"" he said. The president also accused Mr Sessions of giving ""some bad answers"" at his confirmation hearing performance. The price of loyalty - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington With Donald Trump, loyalty will only get you so far. Mr Sessions was the earliest and most enthusiastic of Mr Trump's top-tier political supporters, and he was rewarded with a plum Cabinet appointment. Now, however, that position of power appears not quite as golden a prize. While the former Alabama senator has toiled to implement the president's agenda as attorney general, Mr Trump personally blames him for the ongoing independent counsel investigation that has bedevilled his presidency. The irony is that while Mr Trump views Mr Sessions's recusal from the Russia probe as a betrayal, the attorney general made clear during his confirmation hearings that he would likely do just that if he were implicated in an investigation that had not yet begun in earnest. It was only later that then-FBI Director James Comey - himself a target of the president's scorn - revealed the Trump campaign itself was under the microscope. Now the president has made clear that Mr Sessions lacks his full confidence. While the attorney general says he loves his job and plans to keep it, how secure can his position be when his boss lobs bomb after bomb his way from the White House? Mr Sessions would have headed the justice department's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the US presidential election. Congress is also conducting inquiries. His recusal ultimately led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to lead the investigation. The Times interview reflects the anger the president feels at this development. He said: ""A special counsel should never have been appointed in this case... Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job, and I would have picked somebody else."" Mr Trump said Mr Sessions had given him ""zero"" notice of the recusal. ""How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself before the job, I would have said, 'Thanks, Jeff, but I can't, you know, I'm not going to take you.' It's extremely unfair, and that's a mild word, to the president."" 'I didn't do anything wrong' Mr Trump then reflected on the performance of Mr Sessions at his Senate confirmation hearing in January at which he denied meeting any Russians. He later revealed he had met Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. Mr Trump said: ""Jeff Sessions gave some bad answers... He gave some answers that were simple questions and should have been simple answers, but they weren't."" The president suggested the justice department's Russia investigation was rife with conflicts of interest, not least that Mr Mueller had wanted to replace James Comey, who Mr Trump had sacked as FBI director. ""There were many other conflicts that I haven't said, but I will at some point,"" Mr Trump said. Mr Trump warned Mr Mueller about straying too far from his remit but again said he did not think he was personally being investigated. ""I don't think we're under investigation,"" Mr Trump said. ""I'm not under investigation. For what? I didn't do anything wrong."" US media have reported that Mr Mueller is investigating Mr Trump for possible obstruction of justice, both in the firing of Mr Comey and over whether Mr Trump tried to end an inquiry into sacked national security adviser Michael Flynn. Associated Press news agency quoted a Trump adviser as saying that the president's comments did not mean he was going to sack the attorney general, but the adviser questioned whether such a public dressing-down might prompt him to quit.

It has been shared online and was first reported in The Times showing a worker swinging piglets by a back leg and smashing their heads against a wall. Red Tractor has removed the Eaton Bray-based farm from its scheme. The BBC has approached the farm for comment. The film which emerged this month also showed dead piglets left on the floor of the shed and larger pigs are shown in seemingly overcrowded pens where they are lying on top of each other. 'Highest standards' Red Tractor said ""a small minority of farmers may breach the rules"" and ""this behaviour will not be tolerated"". ""Those discovered are removed from the scheme as was the case with Rosebury Farm,"" it said. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) has confirmed the footage was filmed at the Bedfordshire farm. The Times reported the farm's owner has apologised, saying he had worked with pigs for 25 years and their welfare was important to him. He pledged to give better training to staff. Red Tractor said when some animals became too ill to treat, farmers were ""permitted by law to humanely 'dispatch' such casualty animals"" using an internationally-recognised method and after being trained by their vet. ""On occasions a small minority of farmers may breach the rules and by doing so are cheating the system that is designed to re-assure the public,"" the statement said. ""Red Tractor work to ensure the highest standards are maintained.""

His acclaimed artworks documented life in County Durham's pit villages and have become hugely popular. Now, extracts from some of his sketchbooks are to go on show at Durham University's Palace Green Library. Cornish, who died in 2014, said he hoped his sketchbooks would ""have a life of their own and be of interest to people"". The studio at his home in Spennymoor contained 269 sketchbooks featuring a range of images from quick sketches to finished drawings. Liz Waller, director of library and collections at Durham University, said: ""These treasures, focusing on his observations of life, landscapes and family, offer an intimate insight into his personal thoughts and reflections. ""Some of the sketchbooks and loose drawings also link directly to paintings featured in the exhibition, showing the progression from an initial observation through a series of steps to a finished work. ""Norman is an icon of North East life and art. We feel honoured to be part of celebrating the centenary of his birth and privileged to be hosting this very special exhibition."" Cornish's son, John, said: ""My father's sketchbooks offer an extraordinary insight into his world. For him, drawing was a compulsion; in his words sketching was 'an itch that he had to scratch'. ""His sketchbooks contain a wealth of interesting images, including spontaneous character studies, bar scenes and so much more."" Norman Cornish: The Sketchbooks will run from 16 November until 23 February. Related Internet Links Norman Cornish Durham University

input: Mr Robinson had broken the site's advertising rules, said YouTube, adding that his channel covered ""controversial issues and sensitive events"". The decision means the channel, which has 270,000 subscribers, will not earn revenue when people watch the videos. Mr Robinson denied they contained any ""hateful"" content and said he was the victim of ""continued censorship"". 'Derogatory and disparaging' The video most recently posted to the channel shows Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, punching a migrant on an Italian street and includes references to a ""rape jihad phenomenon"". YouTube said it believed in freedom of expression but also had a duty to protect viewers from ""derogatory and disparaging"" content. The decision comes a day after YouTube removed adverts for anti-Islamic group Britain First from its site, saying they breached its advertising rules prohibiting ""hatred, intolerance or discrimination"". A Britain First representative said: ""Britain First is at present suing Facebook in Belfast for political discrimination. Once that case is resolved, in February, we will launch proceedings against YouTube for their politically motivated censorship."" 'Coffers plump' Campaign group Hope Not Hate said social media companies had been ""too slow"" when responding to reports of hate speech. ""Lennon and others in the far right are utterly reliant on social media and crowdfunding platforms to keep their coffers plump,"" it said. In November, PayPal announced it would no longer process payments for Mr Robinson, saying he had broken its policy on acceptable use. In May, Mr Robinson, 35, was jailed for contempt of court. The 13-month sentence sparked a series of #freetommy protests. The conviction was later quashed after procedural concerns. The case has now been referred to the attorney general. In March 2018, Mr Robinson was banned from Twitter. It is understood that his account was suspended for breaking its ""hateful conduct policy"".

input: The decision follows talks with clergy and parishioners of St Patrick's Church in north Belfast and community leaders. Last month, bands defied a ruling banning music at the church. In the subsequent riots, seven police officers were injured. The Parades Commission have yet to make a ruling. The 29 September parade marks the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Ulster Covenant in opposition to home rule in Ireland. The Parades Commission had placed restrictions on the 25 August march following events on 12 July, when a loyalist band was perceived to have played a sectarian song outside the church. 'Frank conversations' However, that band defied the commission's determination, and other bands, which were restricted to playing a single drum beat, also breached the ruling. The Institution later apologised. In a statement on Monday, the Orange Order said: ""Sadly there has been an unhealthy focus on the parade at a point were no previous contention existed; St Patrick's Roman Catholic Chapel in Donegall Street. ""Occurrences at St Patrick's on 12 July and the 'Last Saturday' have already been the subject of statements clarifying that for any inadvertent offence caused, no hurt was intended. "" It added that quiet, frank and constructive conversations had taken place with the clergy and parishioners. The statement said that in a ""respectful and sincere effort"" to address what they heard and following further conversations with bands, political leaders and local representatives, the Ulster Covenant centenary parade would play hymns when passing St Patrick's Church. ""The return parade in the early evening will show similar respect,"" it added. Sinn Fein's Gerry Kelly said the Orange Order statement was ""not sufficient"". Mr Kelly said the Order should enter ""direct dialogue"" with residents in nearby Carrick Hill if it wanted to find a resolution to the dispute in the area. However, the grand chaplain of the Orange Order in Belfast, Mervyn Gibson, said the Order does not believe a meeting with residents was necessary.

input: Police are investigating a series of posts on the grime artist's social media accounts. He has been temporarily banned from both Twitter and Instagram. Priti Patel said the posts were anti-Semitic and ""abhorrent"". ""Social media companies must act much faster to remove such appalling hatred from their platforms,"" she said. Wiley, 41, known as the ""godfather of grime"", shared conspiracy theories and insulted Jewish people on his Instagram and Twitter accounts, which together have more than 940,000 followers. Twitter removed some of Wiley's tweets with a note saying they violated its rules - but other tweets were still visible 12 hours after being posted. It later said Wiley's account had been locked for seven days. Facebook - which owns Instagram - said on Sunday that the platform had also blocked the rapper from his account for seven days, and that there was ""no place for hate speech on Instagram"". But Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the steps taken by Twitter and Instagram were not enough. In a letter to bosses of the two social media firms, he said that when the material was published on their platforms, ""the response - its removal and the banning of those responsible - should be immediate. ""It takes minutes for content shared on your platform to reach an audience of millions. When someone influential shares hate speech, in that time it may have an impact on the views of many who look up to them."" Mr Khan said it was ""particularly disheartening"" when social media had played a ""positive role in amplifying the vital voices"" of the Black Lives Matter movement recently. Wiley's series of posts began on Friday night and his manager John Woolf's initial response was that, having known the artist for 12 years, ""he does not truly feel this way"". But on Saturday, Mr Woolf said he had ""cut all ties"" with the London-born rapper and that there was ""no place in society for anti-Semitism"". Wiley first entered the UK singles charts with Wearing My Rolex in 2008. His subsequent hits include Heatwave in 2012 and Boasty in 2019, a collaboration with rappers Stefflon Don and Sean Paul and actor Idris Elba.

input: Some 20 teenagers originally faced murder charges following the 2010 murder of Sofyen Belamouadden under a law increasingly being used to tackle gang violence. After four trials lasting 21 months, three have been convicted of murder, five of manslaughter, including Bayode, 12 of lesser charges and three cleared. The case is the latest example of how the law of joint enterprise can be deployed to successfully prosecute crimes involving large numbers of people. But some campaigners argue the law is a ""lazy"" option for prosecutors and can lead to miscarriages of justice. The centuries-old law allows a whole group of people to be prosecuted for the differing roles they played in a murder. There is a version of the law in Scotland, although it is applied slightly differently. Historically, joint enterprise helped authorities deal with duels, enabling them to prosecute the duellers, their supporters and doctors who treated the wounded. To make a normal murder charge stick, prosecutors need to prove the defendant intended to kill. But the terms of joint enterprise are different - and at the heart of it is the concept of foresight. Prosecutors must prove the defendants were involved in some kind of common criminal enterprise and, in the course of their actions, the individuals could have foreseen that one member of the group might kill or inflict serious harm. In other words, if three friends were walking down the road and one stabbed a passer-by, the others could not be prosecuted if they genuinely had no idea that their companion was carrying a knife or intended to use it. But if the trio looked for trouble, and each person knew that one of them was carrying a knife as a weapon, then each could be convicted over its use because they could have foreseen the consequences. The most well-known and controversial conviction involving joint enterprise was that of Derek Bentley in 1952, for the murder of a policeman. He was convicted of the shooting and subsequently hanged. But he did not pull the trigger and the killer was too young to be sentenced to death. Bentley was in fact convicted on his disputed words - ""Let him have it"" - and on the joint enterprise principle that he could have foreseen the outcome. After a long campaign, the Court of Appeal quashed the conviction in 1998. A more recent case went all the way to the House of Lords. In 2004, Tyrone Clarke was stabbed to death in a gang fight in Leeds - and four men were convicted of his murder. They lost their appeal after the Law Lords concluded they could be found guilty by joint enterprise, even though there was no evidence that any of the four had inflicted the fatal injuries. The legislation has been used increasingly in recent years to deal with knife crime among teenage gangs as it allows police to cast a net widely and deal with walls of silence. Metropolitan Police Commander Simon Foy said this was a reflection of detectives' growing experience in investigating such murders. ""I've heard it called a lazy law and that we're just scooping people up, but it's a painstaking account of everyone who has been involved. That description is not accurate,"" he says. But campaign group Joint Enterprise Not Guilty by Association (Jengba) says the law promotes miscarriages of justice. It has been approached by 338 people who say they have been wrongfully convicted. ""Many of whom are serving life sentences for something they did not do, did not foresee what was going to happen nor intend to happen, but have been convicted by an archaic law that is being abused to get convictions and not justice,"" co-ordinator Gloria Morrison says. You can find out more about the history and development of the law of joint enterprise by listening to this BBC Radio 4 Law in Action programme from 2009.

Earlier, MPs warned there will be ""severe"" impacts in the absence of specific solutions for the border. The Commons Home Affairs Committee is investigating what could happen when the UK leaves the EU customs union. It said decisions are needed urgently, on issues including ""infrastructure improvements, systems and capacity"". Speaking on Thursday night, Mr Clarke said: ""The border problem in Northern Ireland, the supreme importance of keeping the settlement in place, retaining peace in Northern Ireland, is probably the single biggest, most important reason why it would be preferable for the United Kingdom as a whole to stay in the single market and the customs union. ""If the Brexiteers, these right-wing nationalists, won't allow us to do that then the best solution after that - I agree with the taoiseach actually - is to have a border down the Irish Sea."" The UK government has said it is aiming for a deal which will avoid any physical infrastructure at the border. However, the Irish government has cautioned that the UK will need to stay in an arrangement similar to the customs union in order to avoid a ""hard"" border. The UK is due to withdraw from the EU in March 2019 when it will also leave the customs union. 'Gridlock' The customs union means EU member states do not impose tariffs or require customs declarations on goods from other member states. The UK government has said that after it leaves, it wants to agree a new ""innovative"" model to avoid holdups at the border but negotiations on this have yet to begin. The committee's chairwoman, Yvette Cooper, warned that as things stand, the first day of Brexit could see ""gridlock on the roads of Northern Ireland"". The inquiry did not take separate evidence on options and arrangements for Northern Ireland. However, some witnesses were clear that the Northern Ireland border presents particular challenges for post-Brexit customs arrangements. Jack Semple of the Road Haulage Association said that the companies he represented struggled to see how the proposed models for post-Brexit customs arrangements could work on the island of Ireland. The committee said that the government's plans for expanding the use of the ""trusted trader"" Approved Economic Operator and approved warehouses schemes could also help address some of the specific challenges at the Northern Ireland.

input: On 15 November, 37 police and crime commissioners will be elected in England along with four in Wales. The PCCs, as they will be known, will be tasked with scrutinising their force and holding it to account. But how much do you know about the elections, and what issues should the new commissioner in Devon and Cornwall be focusing on? BBC News has asked people living in both counties about their views. Elaine Dyer - Cornwall Elaine Dyer said she had not heard much about the elections. She said: ""I don't really care because I've never been involved with the police. ""I don't know if they [the commissioners] would make any difference to the way the police are run. ""It's good in some ways that they are going to be independent, but I wonder how easy it will be for them to communicate with people in the police force."" She added that Devon and Cornwall Police could perhaps do more to tackle shoplifting. Sharon Hart - Devon Sharon Hart said she had not heard about the police and crime commissioner elections. She said those without a police background would not be able to do the job effectively. ""We don't see enough police, there's a lot of community police [support officers, or PCSOs], but they don't have the same powers."" Viv Holmes - Devon Viv Holmes said it was ""about time"" that the police had a commissioner in charge of setting the budget, and hiring and firing chief constables. ""I think it's a very good thing, I think everybody should vote,"" she said. ""We might be able to walk the streets at night a bit better then."" She added that she did not think candidates should not be standing for a party. Rebecca House - Cornwall Rebecca House said: ""I hadn't heard about the elections but I do care because I think it's important that there's some change in the police force. ""Crime is rising among young people especially in places like Newquay where drinking has got out of hand and something needs to happen. ""I think a local person needs to step in because they know the issues."" She added that she was also aware of problem areas in St Austell and Bodmin. Ms House said: ""I think they should do a lot more about drugs, especially policing in nightclubs. ""When I went into Plymouth for a night out they were doing random searches all the time but in Cornwall you never really see it happen. ""A lot of places in Cornwall go unnoticed and people should feel safe on the streets wherever they are."" Dale Johnson - Devon Dale Johnson said: ""If the candidate does not have a police background, why are they in a position to decide who's in the police?"" He said he was concerned about the number of police on the beat and the impact of the police cuts. ""It's a shame it [the role] has got mixed-up with politics. ""People are quite easily influenced."" Maggie Joines - Cornwall Maggie Joines said: ""I think it will be useful to have someone who is unbiased. ""I hope they will make a difference, but I have my doubts. ""I think it will be extremely difficult for them because they are coming from outside the police and they are going into an institution that is quite closed."" She added that she thought the police had been ""bogged down"" with too much paperwork and they had been taken away from their ""core business"". John Lamont - Cornwall John Lamont said: ""We live in a democracy and everybody should take the opportunity to vote. ""But if you ask most people, they don't even know about it. ""The police commissioner is a good thing, depending on who gets in."" He added that there were not enough police on the beat. Matt Lewis - Cornwall Matt Lewis said he had seen some stories on TV about the PCC elections but did not know a lot about it. He said: ""I live on a farm in the middle of nowhere... crime on the streets doesn't really affect me overly. ""As soon as the price of metal goes up, gates and grain trailers are stolen."" He added that he hated drink driving ""with a passion"". Brian Mahon - Devon Brian Mahon said he did not know who was standing, when polling day was or how the elections worked. ""I would have thought it would be helpful if the commissioners had some experience of being in the police,"" he said. ""However, sometimes someone from outside the organisation could be a better idea."" He added that there were not enough police on the beat and that officers had too much paperwork. Jeremy Pearson - Devon Jeremy Pearson said: ""I think it [the role] is a load of politics really. ""It's turning police away from what the citizens need and making it more politics-based."" He added that he was concerned the role could lead to certain crimes being tackled and other areas being forgotten about.

input: In the years since, fans have travelled to recreate the stunt, landing the real-life owner with hours of cleaning. The show's creator even stepped in in 2015, asking the pranksters to stop. Now the owner has reached breaking point, according to local media, building a 6ft iron fence to keep people, and their pizzas, out. In the programme, actor Brian Cranston chucks the pizza after his wife discovers his drug-dealing alter-ego and refuses to let him in the house. Frank Sandoval, who runs a local Breaking Bad tour company, told local news station Kob4 that he has had to climb onto the roof to pull pizzas thrown by tourists down. Joanne Quintana said her mother, the owner of the house, has had to deal with hundreds of people over the last few years trespassing, taking photographs and even attempting to steal rocks as souvenirs. ""We feel like we can't leave because when we, do something happens and that's ridiculous,"" she said. The crime-thriller ended four years ago but creator Vince Gilligan scolded fans on a 2015 podcast about their behaviour while sightseeing. ""There is nothing original, or funny, or cool about throwing a pizza on this lady's roof,"" Gilligan said. ""It's been done before, you're not the first."" You may also like:

input: Mr Sunak confirmed that employees will continue to receive 80% of their monthly wages up to £2,500. But he said the government will ask companies to ""start sharing"" the cost of the scheme from August. A quarter of the workforce, some 7.5 million people, are now covered by the scheme, which has cost £14bn a month. The chancellor said that from August, the scheme would continue for all sectors and regions of the country but with greater flexibility to support the transition back to work. Employers currently using the scheme will then be able to bring furloughed employees back part-time. Mr Sunak will attempt slowly to reduce the cost to the taxpayer of the subsidy scheme, but full details are still to be worked out. However, sources have told the BBC the Treasury stills expects to be paying more than half the costs between August and October. Later on Tuesday, in an interview with the BBC, Mr Sunak said the number of job losses ""breaks my heart"", adding: ""That's why I'm working night and day to limit the amount of job losses."" Cliff edge Mr Sunak told the Commons said: ""I'm extending the scheme because I won't give up on the people who rely on it. ""Our message today is simple: we stood behind Britain's workers and businesses as we came into this crisis, and we will stand behind them as we come through the other side."" There has been growing concern about the cost of the scheme, and last week Mr Sunak said it could not continue in its current form. However, he was under pressure to announce changes soon to avoid a so-called ""cliff edge"" in which employers begin mass redundancies. Any company seeking to cut more than 100 jobs must run a 45-day consultation, meaning 18 May was the last date employers could start this process before the furlough scheme ended in June. The chancellor rejected suggestions some people might get ""addicted"" to furlough if it was extended. ""Nobody who is on the furlough scheme wants to be on this scheme,"" the chancellor said. ""People up and down this country believe in the dignity of their work, going to work, providing for their families, it's not their fault their business has been asked to close or asked to stay at home."" Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said broadly welcomed the changes, saying ""at least we are moving in the right direction"". But she said the ""big elephant in the room"" is over what the government's employer contribution will involve, adding that the ""critical point is that any changes to the scheme must not result in any spike in unemployment"". 'No income and huge costs' Despite the extension of the furlough scheme, Patrick Langmaid said it's still unlikely to stop him making people redundant from his Mother Ivey's Bay holiday park, at Padstow. He has furloughed seven staff and has nine still working. The handful of staff he would usually employ seasonally he has let go. ""There is no income - and huge costs,"" he says. ""We are very worried about how we, as employers, are going to make contributions through August, September and October [when employers will be expected to share the costs of the scheme]"", he said. ""I am very, very worried about how I am going to cope in the winter. ""I've already started briefing my team that there will have to be redundancies,"" he says. He reckons four or five jobs may have to go, depending how long the lockdown lasts. Dealing with redundancy is ""horrible"", he says, adding: ""It is really not a nice time to be running a business."" No 'silver bullet' Businesses largely welcomed the extension, with business group the British Chambers of Commerce saying the move would bring ""significant relief"" to employers and workers, And Stephen Phipson, chief executive of manufacturing group Make UK, said it would avoid ""a looming cliff edge triggering significant redundancies for many companies and recognises the need for greater flexibility as the economy fires up."" However, he warned that there was no ""silver bullet"" and that both government and industry would have to be flexible. There was also support from the TUC, with general secretary Frances O'Grady saying the extension ""will be a big relief for millions"". But she added: ""As the economic consequences of Covid-19 become clear, unions will keep pushing for a job guarantee scheme to make sure everyone has a decent job."" Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies economic think tank, estimates the scheme will have cost nearly £100bn by October. It is thought that about 935,000 businesses signed up for the scheme in total. Reports of the demise of the furlough scheme have been somewhat exaggerated. It was never going to be scrapped, especially after the Bank of England stressed the scheme's importance for economic recovery. Over a quarter of all jobs - 27%, 7.5 million in total - are now paid for by the taxpayer, potentially for eight months. After that, the level of subsidy from taxpayer will be lowered, with employers expected to pay a contribution. By August, the scheme could start to look quite similar to longer standing wage subsidy schemes seen in continental Europe. The cost of the scheme to date is already over £10bn. This extension will be tens of billions more, but difficult to put a precise number on this given the lack of detail on the ""employer contribution"". Expensive yes. But what is also costly is letting unemployment sky rocket, as, without the extension, many businesses would have begun 45-day redundancy consultations this week. The question now is how many businesses still see this as a bridge to some sort of normality where furloughed staff can be phased back into their old jobs. Unfortunately some in industries which will not return to normal have already started to fire staff. This announcement buys most workers more time. Are you currently on furlough?

input: There are around 3,000 cases of Lyme disease, caused by tick bites, in the UK each year. Most of those who take antibiotics make a full recovery within months. But infectious disease doctors are warning that long-term Lyme disease cases are often misdiagnosed through expensive and unvalidated tests abroad. Dr Sarah Logan, from London's Hospital for Tropical Diseases, said: ""Most people who now think they may have had Lyme disease, in fact have a syndrome that is more in keeping with chronic fatigue syndrome."" Speaking at a Science Media Centre briefing, she added: ""And because there is increased awareness about it, they are testing for Lyme disease and then they are going on to various different Lyme disease forums on the internet and being told, 'Well actually the UK tests are rubbish, but you need to send it off to Germany.' ""Then they are coming back with a test that is positive and saying, 'You doctors are all wrong and I don't have chronic fatigue syndrome, I have chronic Lyme disease.' ""I think that most people who think they have got Lyme disease in the UK, probably don't."" 'Alternative' diagnosis She cited two cases she had seen where patients, believing they had chronic Lyme disease, had been taking intravenous antibiotics - one developed a Clostridium difficile infection as a result of being on the medication for more than six months. The second patient also developed a serious infection. Dr Logan said it could be that chronic fatigue syndrome was a difficult diagnosis for doctors to give, because it could be hard for patients to get treatment and support, and because of persisting negative views of the condition. ""I think there is a bit about patients not wanting to hear it because of all those stigma reasons, and there is a little bit about GPs hoping - probably not unreasonably - and saying, 'Let's look for an alternative diagnosis because then that is something we can treat.'"" When a Lyme disease test comes back negative, patients may decide to seek testing elsewhere, she said, adding that some patients were paying up to £600 for a consultation and test that has not been validated. Dr Matthew Dryden, a consultant microbiologist at Hampshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said he was also concerned about the issue of ""chronic"" Lyme disease. ""These are reported as true cases of Lyme when almost certainly they're not. The symptoms are very real but most medical tests tend to be normal which confuses both doctors and patients."" He said the focus should be improving the management and care offered to patients with chronic fatigue. ""It really needs improved research and improved management services for these patients.""

input: By Michael BaggsNewsbeat reporter But how about a Swedish festival in the middle of summer where the sun barely goes down? That's the setting for Midsommar, the second film from director Ari Aster. He's the man behind Hereditary, which last year managed to please critics (89% on Rotten Tomatoes) and terrify horror fans. That was his first full-length film. And early reviews of Midsommar seem to suggest he's got a second scary success on his hands. But after decades of horror movies, it's not easy to scare today's film fans. After all, they've jumped at every shock and squirmed in their seats at every gruesome kill - this is 2019 after all. Ari seems to be doing something right in his work. So we asked him: how do you make a modern horror film scary? Here are his tips: 1. Ease up on the jump-scares Cats leaping out of a cupboard? You won't find any of that in Ari's movies - there aren't any jump-scares to be found in Midsommar. ""There is a trend in the genre of essentially stacking jolts on top of jolts and prioritising that over story and character,"" he tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""Jump-scares agitate me and I don't particularly enjoy them."" But if you've seen Hereditary, you'll know there are unexpected scares that make you jump - he just believes they earned their place in the film. ""I had a rule for myself on Hereditary which was, if this is a moment that is asking for a jolt like that - then I'll give myself to it. But for the most part I'll avoid jump-scares and I certainly won't look for them."" For Ari, what's important is how the viewer feels when they leave the cinema, rather than raising their heart rate during the film. ""When I was a kid, the horror films that really struck me were the films that presented me with images that didn't leave me for a while or moods that I couldn't walk right out of,"" he says. 2. Be patient Midsommar is two hours and 20 minutes long. In one early scene Florence Pugh (Dani) has a long phone conversation with her bored boyfriend (Christian), and the camera remains on her face for the whole thing. It's not a film that's in a hurry to get to the gore. ""I know that as a viewer myself, I'm never really taken anywhere by a film unless I'm able to fall into it,"" says Ari. ""If I haven't attached myself to the characters - or to at least one of the characters - I'm completely detached from the experience and don't really care what happens to anybody. ""I do believe in patience and I do believe in establishing a very solid foundation that you can build on."" Midsommar's most unique aspect, the relentless sunlight, was a key part of creating that foundation, despite presenting a ""huge challenge"" for Ari and his crew. ""Making a horror film in broad daylight, I kind-of gave up on the idea of quote-unquote scaring people from the very beginning,"" he says. ""The goal was again to just create a world that people could live in and stand in and lose themselves in."" But horror fans don't need to worry - the film packs enough shocking moments to keep even the most hardened viewers happy. 3. Tap into everyday horror Most of Midsommar is set in a remote Swedish community, but the film opens with a family tragedy for Dani - one which follows her all the way to Europe. The grief in Midsommar - and Hereditary - is something Ari describes as existing ""for us even if only as a low hum under everything else, from day to day, all through our lives."" ""I see both films as being existential horror films that are contending with fears that don't have any immediate remedy. ""Fear of death, fear of losing the people closest to us. The fear that we can never really know the people closest to us. ""I'd say the film is touching on all of that stuff - and at the same time, the movie is a break-up movie."" It was Ari's own grief - a really bad breakup in this case - that prompted him to make Midsommar and he hopes people who've been through something similar will understand his intentions in making the film. ""My goal - and I was saying this to my producer and my cinematographer before we even made the film - if the film ends up working, I hope that people go to when a relationship ends and they're going through a break-up,"" he says. ""I'd say that would be my fantasy for how this movie might live."" And that's definitely something you might want to think about when you've seen how Midsommar ends.

Alun Davies said threatening legal action ""sounds like the last breath before you're thrown out of the pub"". Mr Davies said he was not convinced the Welsh Government would ""have a leg to stand on"" in trying to shape international trade deals after Brexit. Following Donald Trump's comments during last week's trade visit that the NHS would be ""on the table"" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was ""absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation."" The US President then rowed back on his initial comments following criticism from a number of MPs. Asked about her response to President Trump's remarks as she gave evidence to the Assembly's Brexit committee on Monday, Ms Morgan said ""legally, it would be difficult for us to stop because we don't have a veto over trade"". ""Politically, I think it's extremely unlikely to happen,"" the international relations and the Welsh language minister said.

Responding to the criticism, Ms Morgan said: ""Is the current intergovernmental structure adequate? ""Absolutely not... and it's not just in relation to trade, it's in relation to almost every aspect of government policy. So, that infrastructure needs to be built.""

input: The Armada portrait, thought to have been painted in 1590, was being sold by descendants of Sir Francis Drake. An Art Fund appeal generated £1.5m from 8,000 donations. The Heritage Lottery Fund gave £7.4m; the Art Fund and Royal Museums Greenwich were major donors. The picture will go on show at the Queen's House in Greenwich, near the site of Elizabeth's birth, in October. 'Inspiring female leadership' The painting, considered to be a masterpiece of the English Renaissance, commemorates one of the most famous moments of Elizabeth's reign, the failed invasion of England by the Spanish Armada in 1588. Sir Francis was the vice admiral of the English fleet at the time and it is believed he may even have commissioned the painting, which is unusual for its large size - 3ft 7ins by 4ft 1in (1.1m by 1.25m) - and horizontal format. The Art Fund donated £1m to the cost of the painting, while Royal Museums Greenwich supplied £400,000. The remaining funds came from the Linbury Trust, the Garfield Weston Foundation and the Headley Trust. Stephen Deuchar, director of The Art Fund, said the campaign to save the painting had been ""a triumph of popular will"". ""Record numbers of donors, large and small, stepped forward with determination and generosity, creating an irresistible momentum that has brought this great work into public ownership at last,"" he said. HLF chairman Sir Peter Luff said the painting was ""a compelling historic icon, illustrating as it does a decisive conflict, inspiring female leadership, maritime power and the emergence of the Elizabethan 'Golden Age'"". ""This image has shaped our understanding of the Virgin Queen for over 400 years and I am delighted that it will now have such an appropriate permanent home in Greenwich,"" he added. The painting will be the centrepiece for the reopening of the Queen's House on 11 October. It will then undergo a conservation process to ""restore its fragile painted surfaces"" before becoming part of an exhibition and outreach programme, an Art Fund spokeswoman said. Among those who donated to the appeal were a seven-year-old Wakefield girl, who sold Elizabeth I cupcakes whilst dressed in a costume inspired by the painting, and pupils at St Paul's Girl School in London, who held a bake sale to raise funds. St Paul's history teacher Blanche Girouard said the girls ""study the portrait when we teach Elizabeth I and the Armada, so [they were] very keen to help save it for the nation"".

input: Along Came Polly co-star Jennifer Aniston, Laura Dern and Martin Short paid tribute to the comedy star. Stiller, 46, joins past award recipients Tom Cruise, George Clooney and Steven Spielberg. He joked: ""It is probably going to be painful for me to go through"", adding the tribute would be ""more roast-like"". He said: ""Hopefully it will be fun and definitely like the kind of a nightmare you have to go to, and know you're gonna have a whole evening devoted to people talking about you, and have to look at stuff that I've done, and stuff I've tried to lock out for years."" Stiller's memorable performances include supermodel Derek Zoolander and roles in There's Something About Mary with Cameron Diaz and the Meet The Parents series, opposite Robert DeNiro. He has also directed and produced several films with credits including Submarine and Megamind in 2010, Tropic Thunder in 2008 and Starsky and Hutch in 2004. Born into a comedic family, Stiller has been working in the industry for nearly three decades getting his break with a stint on sketch show Saturday Night Live in 1987. He later won an Emmy Award for his programme The Ben Stiller Show, which aired on MTV and Fox in 1992. Stiller's co-star in 2010's Little Fockers, actress Laura Dern said: ""He is a filmmaker in every sense of the word, not just when he is directing. When he is producing, when he is an actor on a film, he is thinking about the whole vision of the film, even if it is for another director. And I know that from working with him."" The prize was awarded at the Beverly Hilton Hotel by American Pie star Eugene Levy and comic actor Martin Short, who worked with Stiller in the animated movie Madagascar 3. ""I think that Ben is constantly pushing his personal envelope trying to see what else he can accomplish that he has not accomplished before,"" he explained, ""And that's the sign of a great artist."" Stiller has recently filmed a remake of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty while a sequel to Zoolander is in pre-production.

input: Hancock, from Ratho, near Edinburgh, intends to spend 60 days on the remote sea rock, which is just 30m (100ft) wide and 21m (70ft) high. He set off on Thursday for the 15-hour trip from South Harris. Heavy seas meant he was unable to land and he retreated to St Kilda but is now thought to be heading back to Harris. The crew of his support ship Orca III had been expecting heavy seas but swells as high as 8m meant Hancock was unable to get to the rock when they arrived in the early hours of Friday. After a 12-hour detour to St Kilda, the Orca III is believed to be heading back to Harris. Rockall, an eroded volcano, lies 260 miles west of the Outer Hebrides. Mr Hancock had taken all food and water with him and planned to live in a 150kg (23st) shelter bolted to the rock in his bid to break the current 42-day record. The father-of-one took nearly half a tonne of equipment for his two-month expedition. That includes the custom-made pod, nicknamed Rockpod, which he built himself. He plans to haul the pod on to Rockall using a diesel-powered winch. Before leaving, he told BBC Scotland: ""It's a converted water bowser which has been fitted with hatches and fixing points so I can fix it to the rock. ""I have a daily routine of exercises and safety checks, and I'm also going to be carrying out some sample collections for St Andrew's University and the Hunterian Museum."" Marathon runner and climber Mr Hancock said bad weather could see him stuck in the pod for three or four days at a time. Record breakers The earliest recorded landing on Rockall was believed to be in 1810, by an officer called Basil Hall from the HMS Endymion. In the past, Ireland, Iceland and Denmark have claimed the rock and the possible oil and gas reserves surrounding it. The UK annexed Rockall in 1955, but its ownership is disputed. The record for longest occupation was set in 1997 by three environment campaigners from Greenpeace. They lived on Rockall for 42 days and renamed it Waveland in protest at exploration of new oil and gas reserves in the surrounding seabed. As well as attempting to break the occupation record, Mr Hancock aims to raise money for the charity Help for Heroes, which supports injured military personnel.

input: But if it does happen, an independent advocate should be appointed for that person, says the NHS guidelines. This follows criticism from watchdogs and a BBC Wales investigation in which experts said the service was in crisis. Health Minister Mark Drakeford said children ""should be accommodated in the most suitable environment"". In a joint report last year, the Wales Audit Office and Healthcare Inspectorate Wales said that despite some improvement ""children and young people continue to be put at risk due to inappropriate admissions to adult mental health wards"". 'Fit for purpose' Ministers say they are now consulting on draft guidance setting out the procedures for local health boards. The document acknowledges that Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) ""have limited capacity to provide comprehensive out of hours services"". However, it says only in ""very exceptional circumstances"" should children be admitted to adult services. Mr Drakeford said: ""This draft guidance sets out our expectation that the admission of a young person to any inpatient unit should be a rare event. ""I expect health boards to ensure services for children and young people are fit for purpose, that care is integrated across services and that inpatient services consider the individual needs of children and young people and develop services to cater for these needs.""

Assistant Chief Constable Paul Brandon said: ""Kent Police takes very seriously and will not tolerate the illegal setting up and running of raves."" 'Disorder broke out' And he added: ""This type of activity causes much distress to communities."" He said police had been called to the area by residents in the early hours but could find no trace of the reported noise. After further calls after 07:00 BST, police searched the area again and found about 25 people in a field. Officers decided to close the event and seize the equipment. Disorder broke out as the equipment was removed and three arrests were made. The remaining people left the site. Then a fourth arrest was made at Canterbury Police station also in connection with the event, police said.

input: The moss, which grows on thatched roofs, was believed to be disappearing because of modern roofing techniques. Richard Lansdown, a moss expert, said: ""It seems to favour middle-aged thatch but can appear on a roof four or five years after re-thatching."" It has been found in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Somerset and Gloucestershire. Moist roofs The National Trust looked at 54 sites and found the leptodontium gemmascens moss on 18 buildings, 10 of which were new sites located in the South West. The trust said the practice of patching up roofs which encouraged the growth of this plant has decreased in popularity, with more people instead opting to have whole roofs replaced. Thatch moss forms dull green patches on roofs and grows up to 1cm tall. Mr Lansdown, who carried out the survey, said: ""Recent work suggests that moist roofs close to trees or in the valleys are favoured by thatch moss."" The National Trust believes it could be more widespread than previously thought. Matthew Oates, a conservation advisor at the trust, said: ""This survey shows that this endearing and harmless little moss has a real future and that it may be more widespread than we first thought. ""People living in thatch cottages in southern England may be hosting this moss alongside the more common and obvious mosses.""

input: The 17-year-old, who cannot be named due to his age, stabbed Matthew Dale, 23, on Lightwood Road in Longton, Stoke-on-Trent, in October. A jury at Stafford Crown Court cleared the defendant of murder, but found him guilty of manslaughter. Mandy Dale said the attack meant her son would never get to see his new baby, who was born after his death. She said all he had wanted was to become a dad and was ""really excited"" about his son Kayden. ""I have been robbed of a life with my son Matty, and as a family we will never come to terms with our loss,"" she said. Staffordshire Police said Mr Dale, from Dresden, Stoke-on-Trent, had gone out with a friend on 4 October and met up with the defendant. After a struggle, they said the 23-year-old was stabbed once in the back and described the 14cm-deep (six inch) wound as ""catastrophic"". Officers found him lying in a large pool of blood on the pavement with other injuries, thought to be from when he fell after being stabbed, and he died on the way to hospital. Det Insp Alan Lyford said: ""This was a tragic case and we'd like to offer our condolences to Matty's friends and family."" The 17-year-old defendant was also found not guilty of possession of an offensive weapon and will be sentenced on 24 May. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

input: Maya Beach, on the Thai island of Koh Phi Phi Leh, will be closed for four months from June. According to officials, the closure is a bid to halt environmental damage caused by tourists. The closure will allow for the recovery of the island's battered coral reefs and sea life. According to local news outlet the Bangkok Post, all marine parks in Thailand are closed from May to October, during the country's rainy season. The closure also allows for marine wildlife to recover from the effects of mass tourism. However, Maya Bay has previously remained open all year round because of tourist demand. ""Islands have very fragile ecosystems that simply cannot handle so many people, pollution from boats and beachfront hotels,"" Thon Thamrongnawasawat, a marine expert, told news agency Reuters. ""Sometimes, a complete closure is the only way for nature to heal."" Mr Thon added that more than three-quarters of Thailand's coral reefs had been damaged by rising sea temperatures and unchecked tourism. Thailand's National Parks and Wildlife Department will set a daily limit of 2,000 tourists when Maya Beach reopens, and boats will no longer be allowed to anchor there, according to the Associated Press. More than 35 million tourists visited Thailand last year.

input: The affected section of Neath Road in Hafod runs from the Liberty Stadium to the traffic lights at Dyfatty. It has suffered for a number of years with traffic problems. The Nowcaster system monitors air, traffic and weather and sends messages to signs in the city centre telling motorists to use other routes. The information signs have been erected along Fabian Way, Quay Parade and in the Hafod area. The scheme was first announced two years ago but there have been delays in developing the software for Nowcaster, which was trialled and developed in Sweden. Exceeding safe levels Mark Thomas, Swansea council's cabinet member for environment and transportation, said: ""This system is one of the first in the country to be developed and it's taken a couple of years for us to get to this point. ""We are confident that when it is launched it will be a great benefit to residents in the communities where air pollution caused by vehicles is a concern."" Hafod has been a designated air quality management area since 2001 because pollution in the air exceeds safe levels. Heavy goods vehicles were banned from the road in 1999, and speed bumps were removed in 2007 to help ease traffic flow. Buses have also been diverted from Neath Road to another road running alongside and a relief road is being built to help ease congestion.

input: The negotiating teams have no real power There are no members of the government or the Taliban on either negotiating team, just their representatives - and this makes some analysts sceptical. The government team is made up of veteran journalists Rahimullah Yusufzai and Irfan Siddiqui, former ambassador Rustam Shah Mohmand and a retired major from the ISI intelligence service, Mohammad Amir. The Taliban team comprises the chief of an influential madrassa Maulana Sami ul-Haq, the chief cleric of Islamabad's Red Mosque, Maulana Abdul Aziz and religious party Jamaat-e-Islami leader Prof Ibrahim Khan. These teams had been tasked with simply charting a ""roadmap"" for talks but many believe the teams do not have the full trust of their respective backers - the government and the Taliban. These are just talks about talks It's very unclear what they are actually going to talk about: a ""roadmap"" for talks may simply be a timetable for setting out desirable goals such as a ceasefire. Media outlets have deployed a series of tortuous phrases to try to summarise what is at stake in these meetings. But the first task is for the two teams to learn to trust each other. The government excusing itself from talks on the very first day does not bode well. That may reflect the fact that the Taliban committee was drawn up at the last minute. Indeed a prominent Islamic leader withdrew from the team the day before talks were to start. Others point out that simply meeting would be an achievement in itself. The two sides might just be buying time Some analysts believe the government is simply buying time and that they are actually waiting for July 2014 when US forces withdraw from Afghanistan, creating a scenario whereby Pakistani militants could spill over the border to fight in Afghanistan. The government has always denied seeking to influence the balance of power and militancy in Afghanistan. But it has nevertheless been under intense pressure after a spate of bloody Taliban attacks within Pakistan, particularly after Nawaz Sharif last year campaigned on a platform of talking to the militants. Some say this feels like an attempt to soothe public opinion in the wake of that bloodshed. For the Taliban side, sources in the tribal areas say that these talks are also a way of buying time and postponing any possible military intervention in their region. After the death of former leader Hakimullah Mehsud in a US drone strike last autumn, the Taliban feel under pressure to consolidate support in the Mohmand tribal agency - an area he had influence over. With his death it risks slipping out of the Taliban sphere. The Taliban movement is divided on talks Talks would not have got this far without the Taliban shura (organising committee) agreeing to the process. But that masks profound divisions within the movement. Even before the death of Hakimullah Mehsud there was unease within the ranks of this loose collective of militants about the possibility of talks. The Mehsud clan, which has traditionally been at the helm of the Pakistani Taliban, has two factions. Hakimullah Mehsud, despite protestations that he was ready to receive a government delegation, is widely believed to have been against talks and simply wanted to continue fighting. The other group - represented by Sajna Mehsud - is thought to be open to talks. The Pakistani Taliban's new leader Mullah Fazlullah is currently believed to be in Afghanistan and he has adhered to what the Taliban shura agreed to, but many believe he is personally opposed to talks. Then there are the other groups linked to the Taliban who also feel they have a stake in the matter. The militants in the Mohmand tribal area - led by Omar Khalid Khorasani who is currently in Afghanistan - are also resolutely against the talks. However, the Taliban based in Punjab province are all for talking to the government. So the group representing the Taliban in Islamabad could be forgiven for not knowing which bit of the Taliban they speak for. They have set impossible conditions Even if this preliminary team manages to set a timetable for preliminary talks, many believe little can be achieved because of incompatible goals. The government's first condition will be a ceasefire. However, with such a divided Taliban it is not clear who would agree to this in such a disparate movement. Taliban negotiators have previously demanded the release of Taliban detainees. It is likely they will also demand the withdrawal of the Pakistani army and paramilitaries from the tribal areas, including the Swat valley. Both of these will be difficult for the government to accept. But far more difficult - indeed impossible - is the Taliban demand to impose Sharia (Islamic law) throughout Pakistan. History is not very encouraging Previous peace deals with the Pakistani Taliban have all failed. There have been three major sets of peace talks over the last decade. In 2004 militant leader Nek Mohammed reached the Shakai agreement. It came after an ineffective military operation in Waziristan. Almost immediately after the agreement was signed, he reneged on his commitments. The Sarorogha peace deal in 2005 with Nek Mohammed's successor Baitullah Mehsud was aimed at reducing conflict between the army and the Taliban. In fact confrontations increased in the following months. The 2008 Swat agreement between the provincial government and militants was aimed at ending violence in the region. Within days violence increased and the Taliban effectively took control of the Swat valley before they were finally driven out in a military operation the following year.

input: Emma Loman - understood to be pseudonym - said in a complaint on Monday that Weinstein invited her to Cannes to discuss her career in 2006. She says she was constantly called by his assistant, up to 30 times a day, until she accepted his invitation. Mr Weinstein's lawyer said the claims were ""untrue"", adding they were seeking to have the lawsuit dismissed. ""This lawsuit is an attempt to continue the legal barrage and public attention on Mr. Weinstein,"" Phyllis Kupferstein said in a statement. ""The allegations are untrue and the claims are barred by the statute of limitations. We intend to immediately move to dismiss the complaint."" In the lawsuit, Ms Loman says when she first met Weinstein for meetings she found him to be professional. But, it continues, when she was asked to meet him in his hotel suite for a meeting about what was presumed to be upcoming film roles, the professionalism changed. ""Upon arriving at Weinstein's suite... Weinstein quickly dropped his professional demeanor. He instead overpowered Loman and raped her,"" it states. The lawsuit also stated that Weinstein said he could ruin her career if she came forward about what had happened. ""Fearful both that no one would believe her and the potential retaliation from such a powerful figure, Loman stayed silent,"" the lawsuit says. ""It was only upon the late 2017 revelation of the scope of Weinstein's wrongful actions... that Loman felt safe coming forward to seek redress for Weinstein's rape of her."" Ms Loman is suing Weinstein for assault, violation of human trafficking laws, battery and false imprisonment. More than 70 women have made allegations against Mr Weinstein including rape and sexual assault. Mr Weinstein was charged with rape in May, but his lawyer said he would plead not guilty to the accusations. The 66-year-old is currently out on bail and has pleaded not guilty to six counts allegedly committed against three women in 2004, 2006 and 2013. He will next appear in court for a hearing on 20 September. Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

It comes as executives of firms including Twitter, Bank of America and General Motors have spoken out over racial inequality. George Floyd's death has sparked huge protests against racism and police brutality across the US and globally. Announcing the ""Opportunity Growth Fund"" on Twitter, SoftBank's founder and chief executive Masayoshi Son wrote “Racism is a lamentable thing,” ending his post with ""#BlackLivesMatter"". In a letter to employees the company's chief operating officer Marcelo Claure said the fund, which he will lead, aims to invest in entrepreneurs “from communities that face systemic disadvantages in building and scaling their businesses.” SoftBank also runs the $100bn Vision Fund which invests in startups around the world. Meanwhile, Twitter's Jack Dorsey has become the latest chief executive of a major US technology company to give financial support to an anti-racism organisation. He tweeted that he was making a $3m donation to former NFL player Colin Kaepernick’s Know Your Rights Camp to ""advance the liberation and well-being"" of minority communities. Mr Kaepernick is best known for kneeling during the US national anthem when he was a player for the San Francisco 49ers to protest against police killings of African-Americans. His protests were heavily criticised by conservative figures including President Donald Trump. In recent days some of the biggest corporations in the US have pledged to take action in support of racial equality. On Tuesday Bank of America said it would donate $1bn over the next four years to community programmes and small businesses to help address economic and racial inequality. In a media release chief executive Brian Moynihan said that ""underlying economic and social disparities"" had been made worse by the coronavirus pandemic and the ""events of the past week have created a sense of true urgency"". Driving change Car making giants General Motors and Ford has also condemned racial inequality In a letter to employees, dealers and suppliers, General Motors' chief executive Mary Barra wrote that she was “impatient and disgusted” and emphasised the need to “individually and collectively” drive change. Ford’s executive chairman, Bill Ford, and chief executive Jim Hackett also wrote a joint letter to their workers addressing the “tragic killing of George Floyd” and America’s “systemic racism.” Many other US companies, including Intel, Netflix, Nike and Facebook, have also spoken out about discrimination against African-Americans.

input: By Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News Theresa May has said that the UK is ""enriched by the best minds from Europe and around the world"". She states that providing reassurance to them and to UK scientists working in Europe will be a ""priority"". Mrs May's comments were made in a letter seen by BBC News that was written five days after she became PM. The Prime Minister wrote to one of the country's leading scientists, Professor Sir Paul Nurse, who is director of the Francis Crick Institute in London and a former president of the Royal Society. In the letter she states: ""I wanted to write to you to make clear that the Government's ongoing commitment to science and research remains steadfast"". She adds that her government is committed to protecting science and research funding in real terms. Mrs May also tells the Nobel Prize winner that the reorganisation of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy ""does not signal any reduction in the very high priority I attach to teaching and research"". And crucially on Brexit she says: ""I would like to reassure you about the government's commitment to ensuring a positive outcome for UK science as we exit the European Union. While we negotiate a new relationship with our European partners, we are not turning our backs on European scientists."" The UK receives £850m in research funds from the European Union each year. Full membership of one of the main EU funding programmes requires free movement of labour. British universities employ 30,000 scientists with EU citizenship. Rising uncertainty There have already been reports of UK scientists losing out in EU grant applications and of EU citizens not taking up posts in UK universities because of the uncertainty around funding and the residency status of EU citizens following the referendum result last month. Five days after the result Sir Paul said: ""For science to thrive it must have access to the single market, and we do need free movement."" Mrs May's letter does not offer those commitments but Sir Paul said he was heartened to see that she wrote to him within days of taking office. Sir Paul told BBC News: ""The letter from the prime minister supporting science was most welcome and we look forward to working with her to achieve the best future for British science, which is crucial for the future of the UK."" A copy of the letter was sent to the President of the Royal Society Prof Venki Ramkrishanan, who also welcomed the fact that the prime minister is aware of the important of scientific research to the UK ""These are uncertain times, so having the new prime minister making such a positive commitment to science is very encouraging. She not only reaffirms the government's financial support for science at home but also to ensuring a positive outcome for science in the Brexit negotiations. I am looking forward to working with her and her colleagues to turn these words into action."" Follow Pallab on Twitter

input: David ShukmanScience editor The complex of nuclear power plants at Chernobyl has dominated this corner of northwest Ukraine for decades but the new construction towers over it all. The project is to build what is called a New Safe Confinement – in effect, a giant cover, a kind of dome, to fit over the building that houses the reactor that exploded on 26 April, 1986. The radiation immediately above the reactor is still far too intense for the new enclosure to be built exactly where it is needed – anyone working there can only stay very briefly. So adjacent land has been cleared and then decontaminated – a massive task in itself – to allow the new structure to be assembled before being manoeuvred into position. Sealed future Large enough to accommodate a couple of Boeing 747s or the Stade de France in Paris, and almost tall enough to hold St Paul’s Cathedral in London, the giant cover stands on a system of massive rails. When complete, it will weigh an extraordinary 31,000 tonnes. Over several days, it will be rolled along its special track so as to just slide over the reactor building – a very tight fit – in order to seal it in. The task is “of a complexity and uniqueness we have never faced before”, according to Vince Novak, who runs the nuclear safety department of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. He has led the international drive to make Chernobyl less dangerous. “Until this project is in place, we will not be safe,” he said during a media visit to the site. “The ultimate objective is to protect the environment, contain the threat and deal with the radioactive material inside.” Dangerous mix This material is a nightmare mix of more than 100 tonnes of uranium, one tonne of plutonium, and other highly radioactive elements, formed into a previously-unseen lava-like mass. Added to that are several thousand tonnes of sand and boron dropped on to the site by emergency workers at the time. Vast quantities of radioactive liquids and dust are also present inside a reactor building that has itself long been in danger of collapse. In the months following the accident – when the reactor exploded and burned for 10 days – the authorities attempted to smother the building in an emergency “sarcophagus” of concrete and steel. But this was only ever intended to be a temporary fix and has needed urgent repairs to try to keep it stable and intact. One of the shift managers working at the power station back in 1986 – though not on duty when the disaster struck – told me how that weakness of the building is a serious concern. According to Lenar Sagidulin, the emergency concrete was “just stuck to the side of the building; it was not stable. “All this structure could just collapse, suddenly. There are cracks and holes growing in size, so this new confinement is a good idea and will meet its intended functions.” The confinement system involves some seriously challenging engineering – it’s designed to withstand a magnitude 6 earthquake, a Category 3 tornado and temperature extremes ranging from -43C to +45C. A double skin creates a cavity between the inner and outer walls that helps regulate temperature and humidity, and a complex ventilation system uses a system of negative pressure to keep any radioactive dust trapped inside. The goal is not merely to enclose the damaged reactor and isolate it from the corrosive effects of the weather - but also to create a space in which to start the job of dismantling the most hazardous components. Suspended from the apex of the structure will be remotely operated cranes, designed to tackle tasks too hazardous for human beings. During the assembly phase, the radiation risk has been minimised by the construction of a protective wall right beside the reactor building. This means the workforce at the assembly site receive minimal doses of radiation. The man in charge of the project’s management, Ron Hink, joked that he probably gets a higher dose while flying home to Kentucky. But he acknowledges a greater risk during a crucial stage of the forthcoming operation to install the new structure. Donor gap Although the walls at each end have been shaped to fit over the contours of the reactor building’s roof, teams of workers will still need to be on hand to make sure of a tight seal. Mr Hink said: “That’s probably the most hazardous job we have here. That work is inside the structure and that is fairly high-dose and will require a lot of workers to execute. “They will work on a 15-on, 15-off rotation so they will only work half the month.” Coming up with the design has involved a long and difficult journey. Initially, Russian experts favoured smothering the whole building in a massive tomb of concrete – until the risks of corrosion and cracking were highlighted. Then came the task of raising funds for such an expensive project – currently priced at 1.5bn euros for the confinement system, with a total bill for repair and safety work at the site of 2.15bn. As things stand, the EBRD has committed 675m euros, with the European Commission providing 361m. The third largest donor is the United States with 241m. Ahead of a donors' conference next month, there are concerns about meeting a shortfall in funding. The hope is that existing pledges by the EBRD, the European Commission and G7 nations to cover most of a 615m euros shortfall will be confirmed, with a further 100m euros needed from non-G7 countries. The intention is to have the new structure in place and fully commissioned by November 2017. If that is achieved, it would be 31 years since the disaster itself – but should provide protection for at least a century.

The driver of the car was treated at the scene by paramedics but was not seriously injured, police said. He was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving. The crash happened in the early hours of Tuesday on a section of road designated a Low Traffic Neighbourhood. LTNs are areas where traffic calming is used to discourage drivers from using roads as so-called rat-runs. Residents and cycling groups in the area have previously complained about cars parked on both sides of the road, making passing difficult. Common measures to stop vehicles using local streets as cuts-throughs include filter systems and temporary bollards. Related Internet Links Met Police

input: Knife crime and robbery also increased in the 12 months to September 2017 compared with the previous year, the Office for National Statistics said. About 5.3 million crimes were recorded in all in that 12-month period, up 14%. However, the separate Crime Survey, based on people's experiences, suggests crime continues to fall. This survey, based on interviews with 35,000 households in England and Wales, includes crimes that people do not report to police. The latest police figures for the 12 months to September from 44 forces show: There were 37,443 knife crimes and 6,694 gun crime offences recorded in the year to September. The number of offences involving a knife or a sharp instrument had been falling since 2011 but started rising again over the past three years, the ONS said. This contrasts with the Crime Survey which found that most crimes either fell or were at a similar level. However the ONS says higher-harm violent offences, such as knife crime occur in relatively low volumes, and also tend to be concentrated in cities and are therefore not ""well-measured"" by the Crime Survey. Excluding the Hillsborough stadium deaths and last year's terror attacks from the data, 57 more people were killed or murdered than the previous year - the highest total since 2008-9. The 96 cases of manslaughter from Hillsborough stadium in 1989 were only included in crime figures in 2016, after an inquest ruled that the football fans had been unlawfully killed. Analysis: By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Although there's likely to be a dispute about the accuracy of the police crime figures because they hinge, to some extent, on the way forces log offences, how pro-active they are and the willingness of victims to come forward, they clearly demonstrate a rapidly rising caseload. For example, recorded sexual offences and violent crimes have more than doubled in three years. At the same time, the number of police officers has continued to fall: in the 12 months to last September, down 930 to 121,929. The Home Office says that's the lowest figure since comparable records began in 1996. That combination - rising crime, declining police numbers - is creating enormous strain for forces. But it's unclear whether the smaller police workforce is contributing to the growth in violent crime, particularly what the ONS says are the ""genuine"" increases in knife crime and firearm offences. There were also increases in vehicle-related theft offences, which were up 18% to 443,577, and burglary, which rose by 8% to 433,110, police data showed. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the figures were ""truly shocking"" and should ""put an end to government complacency on crime"". ""The Tories are failing in a basic duty to protect the public,"" she added. 'Smoke and mirrors' The Police and Crime Commissioner for the West Midlands, David Jamieson, said his force had lost more than 2,000 uniformed officers since 2010 and his budget had been cut by 25%. ""Any sensible person can see if you take away a quarter of the budget, you can't carry on protecting the public in the same way,"" he told BBC News. He anticipates having to lose a further 150 officers this year. Police Federation of England and Wales General Secretary Andy Fittes said: ""The reality is there are around 21,000 fewer officers than there were in 2010 and they are having to deal with an ever-increasing number of crimes."" ""To say crime has fallen is smoke and mirrors,"" he added. He added that police officers have ""numerous other roles"" not covered in today's statistics - such as counter-terrorism, sex offender management, policing football matches and missing person searches. 'Redouble efforts' A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""The independent Office for National Statistics is clear that overall, traditional crime is continuing to fall. ""It is now down by almost 40% since 2010."" Policing Minister Nick Hurd also said crime had fallen but added the government was ""very concerned"" about the ""uptick in the most serious violent crime"". He said the government would ""redouble efforts"" to bear down on the increased through legislation and tougher police enforcement. And also to try to steer young people away from ""a culture of violence"".

input: Part of its work will be to publish a list of the 10 most-wanted fraudsters and improve intelligence sharing between banks and police. Figures suggest five million frauds occur every year in England and Wales. Last week, figures showed a rise in so-called CEO fraud, where a worker moves cash after a ""bogus boss"" email. In 2015, fraud was included in the official Crime Survey of England and Wales for the first time. The survey suggested that during the previous year there were 5.1m frauds, including those relating to plastic cards and those committed over the phone or online, with just over half involving some financial loss. 'Shames our system' The Joint Fraud Taskforce will include Financial Fraud Action UK, the City of London Police, National Crime Agency, Bank of England, fraud prevention agency Cifas and CEOs of the major banks. The new taskforce will be announced by the home secretary at an event later on Wednesday, which will be attended by Bank of England governor Mark Carney. The home secretary is expected to say that ""fraud shames our financial system"". ""It undermines the credibility of the economy, ruins businesses and causes untold distress to people of all walks of life,"" she is to say. ""For too long, there has been too little understanding of the problem and too great a reluctance to take steps to tackle it."" The force's task list will include: In the 12 months ending in March 2015, 230,630 fraud offences were recorded by police in England and Wales, an increase of 9% on the previous year. A further 389,718 fraud offences were reported by industry bodies, 17% up on the year before. Figures from Financial Fraud Action UK, the body which co-ordinates the finance industry's response to fraud, show losses from online banking fraud rose by 48% in 2014 compared with 2013. Overall losses on UK cards totalled £479m in 2014, up 6% on 2013 - the third consecutive year of increase. New figures also show a surge in what is known as CEO or ""bogus boss"" fraud over the past six months. From July 2015 until January 2016, 994 reports of CEO fraud were made to Action Fraud, the UK's national fraud and internet crime reporting centre. The fraud will typically start with an email being sent from a fraudster - pretending to be a senior figure in the company - to a member of staff in its finance department. The member of staff will be told that they need to quickly transfer money to a certain bank account for a specific reason. The largest reported amount of money given by a member of staff to a fraudster was £18.5m at a global producer of healthcare products - but the average amount is more in the region of £35,000. Steve Proffitt, of Action Fraud, warned businesses to be on high alert. ""Employees should be encouraged to double check everything they do and never be rushed into transferring large amounts of money even if they do think that it's an important task given to them by their CEO,"" he said.

input: By Charlie JonesBBC News Anne Jones's family had owned the property in Easton Bavents near Southwold in Suffolk since 1925. A storm destroyed a large chunk of the cliff in December, leaving the building 30ft (9m) from the edge. It has since been demolished over a number of weeks, after being deemed unsafe by engineers, and the cliff has eroded by another 10ft (3m). ""The whole family is incredibly sad, my father won't even go down the lane because he can't bear to look at it. There is so much history there and we have rented it out to so many local people over the years,"" said Mrs Jones. ""It's quite depressing, it makes me angry. It feels so unfair that we have lost hundreds of acres of land and we just have to accept it, whereas more prosperous, populated areas get protected."" Easton Bavents was once a thriving village and England's most easterly point. Its church disappeared into the sea in the 17th Century and much of the land surrounding it has been eroded. Mrs Jones's great-grandfather Herbert Boggis used his life savings to buy the 400-acre estate in 1925, but it is now less than half that size. Over the past two decades, the house has crept closer to the cliff edge due to erosion. Juliet Blaxland rented part of the property, which is made up of three terraced cottages, from the family for 12 years. She was asked to move out just before Christmas. The author, who wrote a book about her time living there, said she was very sad to watch the house being dismantled and it was ""a great loss"" to the farm. Peter Boggis, who is Mrs Jones's mother's cousin, started building his own sea defences nearly 20 years ago to protect the area but was ordered to stop after losing a court battle. A government-funded scheme, which was approved in 2012 to help them relocate, did not work out and the landowners have been left to fend for themselves, Mrs Jones said. A spokesman for East Suffolk Council, which is part of the Coastal Partnership East group that manages the coast in the area, said it had ""worked hard... with property owners in Easton Bavents over the last 10 years to try and find ways to alleviate the challenges of losing your property to the sea"". He added they supported those who lose their property to erosion with a planning right to build elsewhere in the district. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

input: It passed an ordinance allowing officials to issue certificates to same-sex couples this summer. The documents are not legally binding but the ward is calling on businesses to recognise the certificates and accord equal treatment. Japan remains a conservative country but is seeing social shifts on issues such as gay rights. The nation's constitution identifies marriage as a union between ""both sexes"". Though the country remains tolerant of homosexuality, same-sex couples do not get legal protection. Normal visiting rights do not apply in hospitals, and they may be refused a tenancy from landlords because their relationship is not recognised. Shibuya, which has 217,000 residents, is a trendy area known for its creativity and liberalism. Its mayor Toshitake Kuwahara told reporters previously that the move was in keeping with the area's character . ""The purpose is to realise a society where everyone can live in hope,"" he said. Gay rights activists celebrated the move on Tuesday, with a small group holding up a banner thanking officials. ""To marry the same sex is no different from marrying the opposite sex,'' said Koyuki Higashi, who appeared with her partner Hiroko Masuhara. Moral obligation The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo says that the ordinance amounts to a moral obligation on Shibuya businesses, which will not be penalised if they do not recognise the certificate. Violators, however, will have their names posted on the ward's website. The district is also planning an educational campaign on gay rights issues. The ordinance was supported by the majority of the area's legislators, but not by representatives of the governing right-wing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The LDP is headed by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who happens to live in Shibuya. His party has come out strongly against the ordinance as undermining the foundations of society, says our correspondent. A recent survey by the newspaper Sankei and television network Fuji News found that more than half of those questioned would support legalising same-sex partnerships and nearly 60% supported the ordinance in Shibuya.

It follows an incident on the A98, close to Cullen, in September 2018. An allegation they attempted to murder a man called Alistair Thompson was withdrawn on the fifth day of the trial at the High Court in Edinburgh. It was claimed the four men drove a car, with a registration plate number BK67 NUH, at Mr Thompson. The Crown also withdrew an allegation which claimed the four men committed a breach of the peace at the same location. The Crown also amended another charge of attempted murder facing the four men. It was claimed that they attempted to murder a motorcyclist called John Sutherland. However, the men are now alleged to have assaulted Mr Sutherland to his severe injury and permanent disfigurement. Clawhammer claim Prosecutors also claim that the four men assaulted a man called Colin Sutherland. It is claimed they drove the same car at him, collided with him and this caused him to fall from his bike and lose consciousness. Prosecutors say they then repeatedly struck Mr Sutherland on the head and body with a claw hammer, a tyre iron and a baseball bat before repeatedly kicking him on the body. It is claimed they then cut Mr Sutherland's clothing with a knife and that they attempted to murder him. The Crown also claims that they assaulted a man called Edward Forrest by striking him on the head and body with a clawhammer which rendered him unconscious. Prosecutors say these alleged actions were to Mr Forrest's ""severe injury permanent disfigurement and to the danger"" of his life. They are also alleged to have assaulted Nicky Syratt to his injury and danger of his life. The trial, before Lady Scott, continues.

input: By Chris PageBBC News NI Political Correspondent But politicians and pundits expected the crunch issue to be a row over the welfare system, which was causing an unsustainable budget black hole. Few, if any, could have seen the status of the Provisional IRA returning to the centre of political attention. The paramilitary group, which killed hundreds of people during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, announced an end to its armed campaign in 2005. Following years of stop-start political progress, devolution appeared to put down roots when a new power-sharing administration was formed at Stormont in 2007. The partnership of the Protestant preacher Ian Paisley and the former IRA commander Martin McGuinness seemed to have brought together political polar opposites. But the relationship between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Irish republicans was always going to be fraught. Who's who Northern Ireland Executive: The ministerial team that runs Northern Ireland's devolved government at Stormont. It is made up of British unionist, Irish nationalist and cross-community elected representatives, set up after an historic power-sharing agreement more than 20 years ago. The largest party in the executive is the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), followed by Sinn Féin, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and the Alliance Party. DUP and UUP: Unionist parties that want to maintain Northern Ireland's union with Britain Sinn Féin and SDLP: Nationalist parties aspiring to a united Ireland. Alliance Party: Neutral on the issue of the union. The Irish Republican Army (IRA): The IRA has existed in various forms in Ireland since the early part of the 20th Century but the latest political row concerns the Provisional IRA. The Provisional IRA was the name used by a paramilitary organisation that killed more than 1,700 people during decades of violence in Northern Ireland, known as the Troubles, which began in 1969. The IRA declared ceasefires as part of the Northern Ireland peace process and in July 2005 it announced a formal end to its armed campaign. During the Troubles, Sinn Féin acted as the political wing of the IRA. Budgetary chaos The most serious disagreement broke out over proposed changes to the benefits system. Sinn Féin blocked the welfare reform legislation which has been introduced in the rest of the UK. They said they wanted to protect the most vulnerable. The DUP, now led by Peter Robinson, claimed Sinn Féin were causing budgetary chaos. Talks leading to last December's Stormont House Agreement appeared to have sorted out the dispute - but the deal fell apart in the spring. Since then, there has been an unexpected new dimension to the political disagreement. A former senior IRA member, Gerard ""Jock"" Davison, was murdered in Belfast in May. In August, another republican - Kevin McGuigan - was shot dead in an apparent revenge attack. The police said they believed IRA members were involved in the killing of Mr McGuigan, although there was no evidence at this stage it was sanctioned by the organisation. Unionists demanded to know why the IRA still existed a decade after it said its campaign was over. Northern Ireland's Chief Constable George Hamilton said Provisional IRA structures remained ""broadly in place"" but added the organisation remained committed to politics and was not engaged in terrorism. Unravelling The Stormont institutions began to unravel. The smaller of the two unionist parties in the Northern Ireland Executive - the Ulster Unionists - withdrew their only minister. The DUP then said it would not be ""business as usual"" and called off the regular meetings of the power-sharing executive. The government called inter-party talks - but on the second day of the negotiations, Sinn Féin's chairman in Northern Ireland was one of three senior republicans arrested by police investigating the murder of Kevin McGuigan. Bobby Storey and the other two men have now been released without charge - but in the meantime Mr Robinson has stood aside as first minister. All but one of his party's ministers are resigning. The DUP's finance minister Arlene Foster remains in post. Mr Robinson has not officially resigned - that allows Mrs Foster to become acting first minister. The consequence of this is that immediate elections are avoided and the Northern Ireland Assembly and executive remain afloat - but only just. Dysfunctional There are ministerial vacancies in Stormont's departments of health, social development, enterprise and regional development. The executive technically remains operational, but dysfunctional. An executive without unionists, even if it is theoretically possible, would not have legitimacy. The DUP have seven days in which they can re-nominate ministers. Mrs Foster has suggested that the party is not ruling that out. Mr Robinson had a telephone conversation with Prime Minister David Cameron before he announced the DUP resignations. Contacts But the prime minister told him he would not agree to the DUP's request to pass emergency legislation at Westminster to suspend the power-sharing institutions. The DUP say their contacts with the government will continue over the weekend. The American, British and Irish governments are all urging the Northern Ireland parties to rescue devolution in the inter-party talks, which are set to begin again on Monday. The last time Stormont was put into deep-freeze was in 2002 and it took five years for devolution to return. The way out of the latest political quagmire is very unclear. But if the governments and the parties do not find one - Northern Ireland's voters may be casting their ballots in an early election or London ministers may step in to take over.

North Yorkshire Police said it was disappointing and meant the force would be stepping up patrols in the area. The concerns come as work continues to transform Harrogate's conference centre into a Nightingale hospital. One officer tweeted at the weekend that he was ""deeply ashamed"" after seeing a group of residents having a street party. In the tweet, which has been deleted, Andrew Ingram said: ""Harrogate is by far the worse place for ignoring lockdown."" Insp Penny Taylor said: ""Whilst we know the majority of people in the town are doing the right thing and staying at home, despite the beautiful weather, it is unacceptable that some people are showing such a blatant disregard for the government's guidance."" Insp Taylor said there had also been a rise in the number of motorists travelling into the town for non-essential reasons. ""To those who think the rules don't apply to them, please remember our NHS colleagues and the very difficult job they are doing right now,"" she added. She said the patrols would disperse groups and enforce social distancing measures and warned ""seeing your mates can wait"". Guidelines state people should stay at home except to buy food or medicines, or go to work.

input: By Zhaoyin FengBBC Chinese Service, Washington Eight years ago, Shizheng Tie, then aged 13, moved alone from China to rural Ohio for one sole purpose: education. She once had a budding American dream, but now she says she is facing hostility in that country. ""As a Chinese living in the US, I am very scared now,"" she says. Tie, now a senior student at Johns Hopkins University, describes America as ""anti-China"" and ""chaotic"". Some 360,000 Chinese students are currently enrolled in schools in the US. In the past months, they have experienced two historical events - a global pandemic and unprecedented tensions between the US and China, which have reshaped their views of the two nations. 'Politicised' and 'anxious' The majority of Chinese students in the US are self-funded and hope their western education will lead to a good career. Meanwhile, Washington has warned that not all students from China are ""normal"", claiming some are Beijing's proxies who conduct economic espionage, orchestrate pro-China views and monitor other Chinese students on American campuses. The Trump administration recently cancelled visas for 3,000 students they believe have ties to the Chinese military. One US senator even suggested that Chinese nationals should be banned from studying math and science in America. Amid the harsh rhetoric, many Chinese students fear that they are being turned into a political target for Washington. Tie, majoring in environmental science, says she is pessimistic about her academic future in the US, given the growing scrutiny over Chinese students and scholars in science and technology. ""I used to think I'd pursue my PhD in the US and perhaps settle down here, but now I see myself returning to China after obtaining a master's degree,"" Tie says. Yingyi Ma, associate professor of sociology at Syracuse University, says Chinese students in the US are now ""politicised and marginalised at an unprecedented level"", as Washington is sending ""very unfriendly signals"". The strained bilateral relations have swayed public opinion, as a recent survey found that 73% of American adults have an unfavourable view of China - an historic high. Prof Ma published a book called Ambitious and Anxious this January, focusing on Chinese students' experience in America. ""If I write the book now, I will only keep 'anxious' in the title,"" she says. 'Unwanted' at home As the coronavirus continues to spread in the US, Tie prefers to return to China, where the outbreak appears to be largely under control. But the country has ordered sharp cuts in international flights to prevent imported cases, leaving many Chinese students overseas, stranded thousands of miles away from their families. On Chinese social media, some comments portrayed these students as spoiled brats, who had fled from the country's fiercely competitive education system and now may imperil its success in containing the virus. ""America wants to kick us out, while China doesn't allow us to return,"" Tie says. This sentiment is commonly shared among Chinese students in the US. Iris Li, a 20-year-old junior student from China at Emory University in Atlanta, describes the students as ""being kicked like a ball"" between the two countries. ""We are getting the short end of the stick from both sides,"" Li says. Racism 'boosts' support for Beijing After worrying about the outbreak in their home country from afar, these young Chinese are now witnessing the coronavirus crisis in the US. They were perplexed by the cultural differences regarding mask-wearing. They were unsettled by President Trump's use of the phrases ""kung flu"" and ""China virus"". Some have even experienced racial harassment firsthand. Racial discrimination during the pandemic has ""burst their bubble,"" Prof Ma says. A new paper stated that anti-Chinese racism boosts support for Beijing's authoritarian rule among Chinese students in the US. Jennifer Pan, co-author of the paper and assistant professor of Communications at Stanford University, says there is a general belief that Chinese students overseas are indoctrinated to wholeheartedly support the Chinese Communist Party. ""That's not the case,"" Prof Pan says, ""What does change their political views is racism."" The research found that college freshmen from China who read derogatory comments against Chinese people are more likely to support Beijing, while general criticism against the government's coronavirus handling did not produce the same effects. Prof Pan says the findings suggest that Chinese students in the US, whose survey responses are ""mature, sophisticated and thoughtful for their age"", can rationally process criticism against China. Rethinking China and America Despite her frustration over China's travel restrictions, Tie says she has become more patriotic since living aboard. ""I had believed America to be a wonderland of dreams, equality and tolerance for all. I certainly don't believe it anymore,"" she wrote in her school newspaper in June, criticising America's ""Sinophobia"". In February, she penned an online petition, protesting against her university hosting a panel with Hong Kong democracy activists. But Tie says she's not a ""little pink"", a somewhat disparaging term for nationalistic Chinese youth active on the internet. ""I am patriotic in a rational way, not as a result of brainwashing,"" Tie says, adding that she views both Washington and Beijing critically, citing the lack of freedom of speech in China. ""Both countries let me down many times,"" Tie says, ""but China is my motherland, so I am more willing to endure that frustration."" Similar to Tie, Li plans to return to China after her study, with transformed understandings of her home and host countries. In early July, Washington announced a policy barring foreign students from staying in the country, but the decision was rescinded after receiving waves of criticism. ""It made me feel hopeful about the US,"" Li says, ""This would not happen in China."" The sociology and religious studies student thinks the pandemic has laid bare the advantages and weaknesses of both political systems. While the Chinese government seems to act more effectively, the US allows dissent, and at times, it is able to correct its own mistakes. American education has made her ""more anti-China,"" Li says with a laugh. She recalls feeling ""very uncomfortable"" when she first arrived in America six years ago and saw her fellow students waving Taiwanese flags, which are seen in mainland China as a symbol for Taiwan independence. But after getting to know the Taiwanese students, she realised that though their views may have been completely different, they could discuss issues respectfully, which is encouraged in American classrooms. ""Studying in the US is an important experience in my life,"" one that she says she'd never regret. ""But I am eager to help change China, where my work may be more meaningful.""

input: The company is talking to Cuadrilla Resources about buying a stake in its licences in the Bowland shale formation in Lancashire. Cuadrilla is among a small number of companies exploring the UK's shale gas potential. The company estimates that there may be as much as 200 trillion cubic feet of shale gas in its licensed areas. The BBC understands a deal between Centrica and Cuadrilla is expected to be concluded in the coming weeks. Centrica is not planning to take a stake in Cuadrilla itself, but rather buy the exploration rights to a part of the shale gas fields. Through British Gas, Centrica is the largest domestic energy supplier in the UK. The BBC's industry correspondent, John Moylan, says Centrica's investment would be a major boost for the UK's fledgling shale gas industry. Fracking controversy Fracking has revolutionised the energy industry in the US in recent years, driving down gas prices and boosting oil production. Drilling companies suggest they may be sitting on vast resources of shale gas in the UK. Earlier this week another drilling firm, IGas, said its licensed areas of Cheshire could hold up to 170 trillion cubic feet of gas. Some industry figures suggest that may be enough to end the need for expensive gas imports. The UK's annual gas consumption is currently about 3 trillion cubic feet. However analysts suggest that only a small fraction of the total shale gas resources in the UK may be recoverable. In a report published earlier this year, the Energy and Climate Change Committee also cast doubt on the value of shale gas extraction. Although it said shale gas in the UK could help secure domestic energy supplies, it also warned that it may not bring down prices. The gas is extracted from the shale rock through a controversial process known as ""fracking"" - forcing water, chemicals and sand underground to release the trapped gas. But it has been blamed for causing earth tremors and there are environmental concerns about water contamination and the large volumes of water required.

input: The Windrush generation were ""badly let down"" and had to follow processes apparently designed to ""set them up to fail"", said the Home Affairs Committee. They called for urgent action to make sure the scandal is not repeated. Home Secretary Savid Javid's top priority is to ""right the wrongs that have occurred"", the Home Office said. The Windrush scandal began to be uncovered earlier this year when it emerged that some migrants from Commonwealth countries, who were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to 1973, were being wrongly categorised as illegal immigrants. Some who had lived and worked in the UK for years were threatened with deportation or refused jobs and healthcare. 'Scepticism and suspicion' Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said people had been ""denied their rights and treated appallingly by the Home Office"" and that there was ""still a very long way to go to put this right or to ensure it won't happen again"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We found when looking at what's happened to the Windrush generation that thousands of people have been denied their rights and have been badly let down by the Home Office. ""It's truly appalling what's happened to people who have been here lawfully, many of them British citizens. ""That's why we looked at areas around the culture that had developed - the lack of discretion, the treating people with scepticism and suspicion - we've looked at some of the policies that affected people, and also the lack of oversight in the system, the lack of any checks and balances to prevent it happening. ""In each of those areas, change is needed to make sure this kind of thing can't happen again."" The ""hostile environment"" approach to immigration used by the Home Office was criticised in the report, with the MPs questioning if it should be allowed to continue in its current form. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has already said he rejects the term, preferring the phrase ""compliant environment"" - but the committee described the renaming as ""meaningless"" rebranding. They committee said: ""It is irresponsible of government to rely on a policy when it lacks information on whether it is leading to injustice or abuse or achieving aims."" The MPs also said they were concerned that enforcement targets may have led to a ""focus on people like the Windrush generation who may have been easier to detain and remove"". Analysis By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent This detailed report, compiled in less than six weeks, is the most comprehensive attempt so far to explain why the Windrush scandal came about and scrutinise the government's response. But tellingly, it suggests there's still a lot of crucial information we don't know: the links between removal targets and bonuses; the advice civil servants gave to ministers on the issue; and how many Windrush migrants have been wrongfully detained, deported and deprived of the rights they should have had. There's also concern that the policies and mistakes will be repeated with other potentially vulnerable groups - undocumented children, people from the Chagos Islands and EU citizens seeking to settle in the UK indefinitely. It's a reminder for Sajid Javid to keep his eye firmly on the ball as the media attention over Windrush inevitably subsides. Some 8,000 people have now contacted the Windrush task force set up by the government, with more than 2,000 receiving documents confirming their right to stay in Britain. But there are ""too many unanswered questions"" and the Home Office should now reveal how many people have been unlawfully subject to deportation, detention and reporting requirements, the report said. Unless lessons are learned from the Windrush scandal, the same mistakes could happen with the three million EU nationals living in the UK who have to take on a new migrant status after Brexit, the MPs warned. They said there are 144,000 children currently in Britain who could be in a similar situation to the Windrush migrants because they do not have the documents proving their right to be here. Failing to solve the problem of those undocumented children ""will leave many in a precarious position, unable to study, work or seek the support of social security as they transition into adulthood"", they warned. Responding to the report, the Home Office spokesman said: ""A lessons learned review, which will have independent oversight, will help ensure that we have a clear picture of what went wrong and how we should take this forward. ""But in the meantime we are already reviewing existing safeguards to ensure that those who are here lawfully are not inadvertently disadvantaged by measures put in place to tackle illegal migration.""

Mohammad Amin Nasab was jailed for 10 years for aiding British intelligence. Mr Esmaili said he would not identify the person sentenced to death because the verdict was subject to appeal. It was not clear if any of those convicted were among 17 people who Iran's intelligence ministry said had been arrested for spying for the CIA earlier this year. The ministry alleged they had been collecting information in nuclear and military facilities and in the private sector - allegations that US President Donald Trump dismissed as ""totally false"". Mr Esmaili also confirmed on Tuesday that the Iranian authorities had arrested the British-Iranian anthropologist Kameel Ahmady. Mr Ahmady was being investigated on suspicion of ""links to foreign countries and institutes affiliated with foreign [intelligence] services"", he said. His wife said in August that he had been arrested at their home in western Iran. In a separate development, state media quoted Mr Esmaili as announcing that an appeals court had reduced the jail term of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's brother from seven years to five. Hossein Fereydoun had been convicted of ""receiving bribes"", ordered to return any illicitly acquired property, and fined about 310bn riyals ($26.7m at the unofficial market exchange rate), Mr Esmaili added. It was reported in May that Fereydoun, a close adviser to the president and senior diplomat, had been handed an unspecified jail term for corruption. The president's supporters had said that the case was politically motivated. More on US-Iran relations:

input: By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent That is according to figures just published by the University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS). Almost half (46.9%) of all 18 year olds in Northern Ireland applied to UCAS by 30 June 2019, a fall of 0.7% from 2018. There has, however, been a 7% rise in the number of non-EU students applying through UCAS to study in Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, the number of 18 year olds in England applying to go to university has risen. However, Northern Ireland still has the biggest proportion of the 18-year-old population applying to go to university of the four countries in the UK. International students In 2019, 10,510 18 year olds in Northern Ireland applied to go to university, down from 11,050 in 2018. As there has been a fall in the 18-year-old population compared to 2018, the percentage drop in the proportion applying is lower than the numerical drop. Overall there were 18,520 university applicants of all ages from Northern Ireland in 2019, compared to 19,310 in 2018. There are a record number of international students applying through UCAS to study in the UK in 2019. 81,340 students from outside the European Union (EU) have applied, up 8% on 2018. UCAS figures also show that there has been a 7% rise in the number of international students applying to begin studying at universities in Northern Ireland in 2019: 2,410 have applied this year, compared to 2,260 in 2018. However, Northern Ireland's universities also admit some international students outside the UCAS system through partnerships with other global universities, so the number of international students applying is likely to be higher than the UCAS figures. The final deadline for applying for up to five universities or colleges simultaneously through UCAS was 30 June 2019. While there has been a rise in the number of unconditional offers made in recent years, most UK applicants will only have their university place confirmed when they receive their A-level results on 15 August.

input: The £80m attraction, called Jurassica, would be built in a 40m (132ft) deep limestone quarry in Portland, Dorset. Science journalist Mike Hanlon, behind the idea, said: ""Jurassica has the potential to create something of global significance."" If it goes ahead, an estimated 500,000-600,000 annual visitors are expected. It could be completed by 2020, creating more than 150 full-time jobs. Featuring a lid-like roof, Jurassica would span about 100m, about a third the size of the Millennium Dome. Comparable with the Eden Project, it would house robot swimming plesiosaurs, fossils and interactive displays. Mr Hanlon said: ""Jurassica will put Dorset on the global map; a real focus that will drive tourism upwards and pour more than £20m into the county's businesses every year."" Dorset Chamber of Commerce said the travel infrastructure to the attraction would be fundamental to its success. The charity is currently carrying out a £30,000 traffic impact study. Ian Girling, chief executive of Dorset Chamber of Commerce said: ""There's no doubt its going to be a tremendous boost for Weymouth and Portland. ""This is a really bold innovative project that could be fantastic for the whole of the county."" Bournemouth University is conducting an economic study to determine the attraction's connections with other sectors of the economy and its likely impact. Prof John Fletcher, pro-vice chancellor for research and innovation at the university, said the attraction would make a ""significant contribution"" to the local economy. He added it would ""broaden the visitor season through its international and educational pull"". Sir David Attenborough is patron of the project and the Eden Project's Sir Tim Smit is its trustee. The project was awarded £300,000 in July from the Local Enterprise Partnership for a feasibility study and a lottery funding application. In November, the charity put in a first round funding bid for a £16m Heritage Lottery Fund Award. The outcome of the bid is expected in April. The 153 km (95 mile) Jurassic Coast, which begins in East Devon and stretches to Old Harry Rocks near Swanage in Dorset, attracts about 12-15 million visitors a year. The Jurassic Coast is considered the only single site in the world that displays evidence of millions of years of the earth's history, exposed in layers of rock in its cliffs. It contains three periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous.

Mr Mallon said services would be closed and multimillion-pound projects reviewed in an attempt to stop the town ""fraying at the edges"". The government said Middlesbrough received more funding than the national average and it should cut wastage. Mr Mallon outlined the financial situation to councillors at a meeting on Wednesday and said he hoped action taken would ""reduce substantially"" the number of potential job cuts, but the loss of about 1,000 posts was ""the best case scenario"". He said it was a ""real shame"" staff would be made redundant but insisted the council was ""duty bound"" to cut spending. 'Temperature rising' The council has just over 2,500 full-time staff, excluding those in schools. More than £32m of the required savings are necessary due to changes in government funding and the authority is facing an increased demand on care services, Mr Mallon said. ""By 2018 or 2019, 75% of the council's budget will be spent on helping children and the elderly. ""The temperature has been rising for a long time and it's still rising."" Ahead of the meeting, Labour group leader Charlie Rooney said the town was being ""devastated"" by government cuts. Conservative group leader Chris Hobson called on the authority to ""start doing things differently"". ""We've got to start running this council as a business,"" she said. ""We've got to start bringing money in ourselves and thinking about how we can do that."" Mr Mallon will announce a list of specific budget proposals next month.

input: Why is Uttar Pradesh important? The northern state is India's most populous, with more than 222 million people. If it were a separate country, it would be the fifth-largest by population in the world after China, India, the United States and Indonesia. Commonly called UP, the state sends the largest number of MPs - 80 - to India's parliament. It is often said that the party that wins the state rules the country. Several prime ministers, including India's first PM Jawaharlal Nehru, have come from here. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is from the western state of Gujarat, also chose to make his parliamentary debut from the state in the 2014 general election when he contested from Varanasi. And voters in the state can easily claim the credit for his Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) stunning sweep of the elections. Of the 282 seats they won, 71 were from Uttar Pradesh. Who are the main players? It's a three-way contest between the governing BJP, the regional Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the state's ruling Samajwadi Party (SP), which is contesting the polls in alliance with the Congress. Since the late 1990s, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party have dominated state politics, with the Congress and the BJP pushed to the sidelines. The family drama gripping Indian politics Why the bicycle could decide an election But this time, buoyed by its success in the general election, the BJP is making a serious bid for victory. The party is yet to declare a chief ministerial candidate and is banking on the popularity and charisma of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to win the polls. Mr Modi has been criss-crossing the state, addressing election rallies and exhorting voters to give the BJP a chance. The Samajwadi Party is led by 43-year-old Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. He led his party to victory in the 2012 state assembly polls and is hoping for an encore when the votes are counted on 11 March. His journey, however, has been far from smooth, especially in the past few weeks when he fought a very public battle with Mulayam Singh Yadav, his father and chief of the party. As father and son fought for power in a manner likened to political drama House of Cards, the party seemed on the verge of disintegrating. But Yadav junior won the duel, and has since forged an alliance with India's main opposition Congress party. The partners have been holding joint election rallies, promising good governance, state development and free smartphones for young people. Pitted against the BJP and the SP-Congress alliance is the Bahujan Samaj Party, led by Dalit (formerly Untouchables) icon Ms Mayawati. The four-time state chief minister, who lost power in 2012, is seeking a comeback. She is hugely popular among her community, but during her earlier stints she was criticised for spending millions of dollars to build statues of herself and other Dalit icons. This time though, she has promised to not spend money on statues and says she will work to lift millions of people out of poverty. What's at stake? Because of its sheer size and numbers, UP is a key battleground. And for the parties in the fray, these elections are being seen as a do-or-die battle. The BJP hasn't done too well in state polls since winning the 2014 general elections, so a victory here is important. Also, the polls are being seen as a referendum on Mr Modi's recent move to ban 500 and 1,000 rupee notes. The timing of the move has been questioned by many and if the party loses, a blame game is likely to begin. A victory for Akhilesh Yadav is crucial as it will cement his position as the leader of his party. If he loses, the rebel faction led by his uncle Shivpal Yadav will get a boost. A win will also bring cheer to the Congress, which has had little joy with voters in the general election or in regional polls for the last few years. And a win is absolutely essential for Ms Mayawati, who has spent the past five years in the political wilderness. Analysts say if she loses this time too, she risks becoming politically irrelevant and may find it very difficult to bounce back. How do the numbers look? With 403 seats up for grabs, thousands of contestants are in the fray, fighting for a share of the pie. More than 138 million voters will be casting their votes at 147,148 polling centres, watched over by thousands of police and paramilitary troops, during the seven phases of voting spread over a month. Despite its political significance, UP remains among India's most backward states with millions living in extreme poverty, a lack of employment opportunities and rampant corruption. For some voters the only tool they have to express themselves with is their vote. And during elections they come out in large numbers to use it - often against those in power.

input: By Charles HavilandBBC News, Colombo The country has not carried out a judicial execution since 1976 but has over 400 prisoners on death row. The authorities want to have an executioner ready in case hangings resume. But three recruits have now abandoned the job within a year after the previous hangman was promoted to become a prison guard. Commissioner-General of Prisons Chandrarathna Pallegama told the BBC that the new recruit - reported to be 40 and from the town of Anuradhapura - ""got shocked and afraid"" after seeing the gallows, which came after several days of training. He had written a letter saying he wanted to resign and had failed to report for training since Monday. Mr Pallegama said the man would be given one month to consider his decision. If there was no change, fresh applications would be called for through a government gazette. The last permanent hangman had also said the gallows made him nervous, and he felt he was lucky only to have done clerical work despite his job title. Two men were then recruited from among 176 applicants but quit the job last year after going on unauthorised leave, reports said. The man who has just resigned is reported to have been the third-placed applicant from that process. Any new execution in Sri Lanka would have to be authorised by President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Those on death row do not include former members of the Tamil Tigers (LTTE) or LTTE suspects.

input: ""It was like the gates of hell. There is no other way to describe it."" For Tony Thomas, 7 February 2009 began as another ordinary day. It had been a summer of record-breaking temperatures, prompting days of safety warnings. But Mr Thomas wasn't overly concerned; they had had scorching days like this before. In the lush, peaceful hills on the outskirts of tiny Marysville, about 90km (55 miles) north-east of Melbourne, he and wife Penni had carved out a fruitful life running a bed and breakfast on a 60-acre property. His in-laws had arrived for a birthday lunch. It was a pleasant gathering, despite the suffocating heat. But in the late afternoon, they spotted smoke in the west. Going for a closer look, they saw fire. ""It came out of the forest behind us on the other side - at 100k [kilometres] it just roared towards us,"" Mr Thomas tells the BBC. At 18.45, the fire hit - ""and pretty hard"". Mr Thomas's family and the B&B guests ran for shelter in the house as he, his brother-in-law and an employee battled the fire. It was effectively three men with buckets and garden hoses against a roaring, wind-whipped blaze. At 21.30, another wind change swung the fire towards the hay shed: ""That threw flaming hay bombs at us for the next hour or so, massive embers and hay landing on us."" ""When you've got 20 to 30 metre-trees burning and the flames are well above that, like a huge ball..."" his voice trails off. ""Why people say gates of hell is because everything turned from light to dark very quickly - the sun got blocked out by the smoke. ""The only thing you could see is the glow of the fire through the smoke. We were choking. We only had large tea towels which we were wetting down constantly and wrapping around our faces so we could breathe."" Nearby, David Baetge was also fighting for survival on his property near the town of Buxton, directly adjacent to a large state park. Armed with a comprehensive fire plan and previous firefighting experience, he had seen the smoke but chosen to stay. Like Mr Thomas, the decision would almost cost him his life. At about 1830, Mr Baetge spotted fire on top of peaks about 3km (2 miles) away - with what he estimated to be 100m-high fireballs. Even for a bushfire veteran, he was shocked at the speed of the fire as it raced towards him. ""The sky was iridescent red with a deafening roar like standing next to a 747 jet,"" he would later recall in his blog. ""It was like being inside a cocoon of smoke with a maximum visibility range of about 30m and the whole of this hemisphere in every direction was glowing cherry red."" He said it was ""like being sandblasted - but with burning embers"". All through this once-bucolic landscape, others faced similar struggles. Karen Curnow was among them. As her house caught fire, she fled in her car with her old dog, hurtling over and around burning trees, guilt-struck at having to leaving her panicked horses behind. Nearby in Kinglake West, local artist Michelle Bolmat was also making a mad dash to safety. ""The ash started to fall, and the darkness came… it became completely black everywhere,"" she tells the BBC. A tree came down in front of her; but as the heat started to build, she revved her engine and drove over it. ""I looked back and saw the fire coming."" All four got through that nightmare night. But when the sun rose the next morning, it was eerily quiet. The lush landscape was gone. ""Our world turned from beautiful colours to black and grey,"" Mr Thomas recalls. ""There wasn't a spot on the property that wasn't burnt and it was the same across the whole area."" Kinglake suffered the heaviest toll, with 120 perishing. In Marysville, 39 people died - 34 of them locals - and the town was effectively obliterated. ""Probably 22 of those 34 were friends of ours,"" Mr Thomas says. After the final embers were doused (the Black Saturday fires continued to 14 March), the true scale of the fires was revealed. About 400 blazes had burned, most sparked by faulty power lines and lightning, but there were also cases of arson. A total of 173 people died - Australia's deadliest ever bushfire event. It left several hundreds more injured, more than 2,000 homes destroyed, and more than 7,500 people displaced. The RSPCA estimated that up to one million animals died. It was unprecedented - even for a country long used to bushfires. Over the years, Australia has been hit with several deadly blazes. But the Black Saturday fires of 2009 were singular in their ferocity - equal to 1,500 atomic bombs. So what made this event so severe? Kevin Parkyn, a Bureau of Meteorology senior forecaster, says it was a combination of record temperatures, unusually strong, howling north-westerly winds in excess of 100km/h (60 mph), and a tinder-dry landscape courtesy of a long-running drought. In Melbourne, the temperature reached 46.4C. ""That's a record for Melbourne in 100 years,"" Mr Parkyn says. ""When you went outside, there was just this blast of hot air - it was like having a hairdryer to the face."" No firefighting force stood a chance, especially when the blazes hit Australia's highly flammable eucalypt forests, he says. Spot fires sprang up kilometres downwind of the main front. ""And all these fires joined together to become this massive fire area - which we call pyrocumulonimbus - that started generating its own lightning,"" Mr Parkyn says. ""And of course, lightning started more fires."" The result was intense temperatures capable of melting metal: ""It was almost like a living, breathing beast."" Did climate change play a role? Mr Parkyn refers to his scientific training: he says it would be hard to say there's no link given the record temperatures now being experienced in Australia in particular, and the frequency of extreme weather disasters internationally. He points to last year's California fires, the US state's deadliest, as one example. The damage from Black Saturday was also exacerbated by urbanisation, he says. Risk Frontiers, a research centre, has estimated that nearly a million addresses in Australia are located less than 100m from bushland. In the aftermath, a royal commission inquiry was announced, resulting in widespread changes in bushfire preparation and protocols. The inquiry put the financial cost of the disaster at A$4.4bn (£2.4bn; $3.14bn). Survivors also secured a A$500m payout - the biggest class action settlement in Australian legal history. But this didn't account for the invisible toll. The Beyond Bushfires report, which surveyed more than 1,000 people affected by the fires, found evidence of significant mental health issues including depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and severe psychological distress. The rates were significantly higher than what would be expected in the general population, it found. Lead researcher Prof Lisa Gibbs, from the University of Melbourne, likens the disaster to a fractured window: the cracks spread far and wide, magnified by the small rural populations. She has seen a measurable increase in domestic violence along with mental health issues. Out of the embers, however, some good has also come. Australia is now significantly better prepared for fires, with new measures including redesigned building codes and improved warning messages. Internationally, Australian researchers are now leading the way in many firefighting technologies - from tanker perseveration strategies to a world-leading electrical-fault study. The Beyond Bushfires report is now used internationally. Regeneration and growth has taken place on a more personal level as well. Mr Thomas is amazed by the resilience of the locals. Communities have rebuilt, the bush has regenerated. For Karen Curnow says it gave her a chance to start anew: ""I don't see myself as a victim or a survivor. I just consider myself a very lucky person."" This week, solemn events have marked the anniversary of the tragedy. But for many scarred directly by Black Saturday, there will be relief when Thursday is over and people can move on, Mr Thomas says. Marysville is slowly recovering but ""it will never be the same town"". ""But as a community we stick together,"" he says. ""We're still here. We're still standing.""

input: Organisers of Go Go Gorillas, a public art trail in Norwich, were contacted by Queen's manager Jim Beach on behalf of the Freddie Mercury estate. The estate claimed the suit ""worn"" by the gorilla breached copyright. It asked the Freddie ""Radio Go Go"" Gorilla sculpture, which Norfolk artist Mik Richardson took three days to create, to be ""taken off the streets"". The sculpture was removed from Millennium Plain, outside The Forum, at 11:00 BST. 'Dreadful and petty' Mr Richardson, 50, of Aylsham, Norfolk, said the decision to order its removal was ""absolutely shocking"". He said: ""It's dreadful. It's petty, really. The night I was told I couldn't sleep."" Mr Richardson was paid £800 to design and paint the gorilla. ""I'm a mural artist and I have to be very careful about copyright,"" he said. ""I didn't copy the suit exactly. I alter enough so that it's fan art, rather than a copy of it. The ""Radio Go Go"" gorilla is one of 53 life-size gorillas decorated by Norfolk artists and displayed on the streets of Norwich over the summer. An additional 67 baby gorillas, painted at local schools, made up the 120-strong public art trail. The Freddie Mercury estate contacted Wild in Art, the company that supplied the gorilla glass-fibre canvases, according to director Charlie Langhorne. 'Enjoy a gorilla' ""They just said that they own the copyright on the suit and asked us to change it,"" Mr Langhorne said. ""That's being sorted. To save any bother we will change it. ""We do quite a few bits and pieces for them but it's no great shakes. ""We would rather not have to do it but it's not the end of the world."" He said the gorilla would be repainted with a ""new and exciting design"" and should be back in place within 10 days. ""People in Norwich will have a new gorilla to enjoy soon,"" he said. Martin Green of Break, one of two charities that will benefit from the auction of the gorillas once the exhibition is over, said: ""It's a disappointing position they have put us in. ""Freddie is one of our most popular gorillas on the trail and now we've got to remove him from the streets. ""It's a sad story, but the positive news is that we'll end up with another gorilla on the streets."" The Born Free Foundation, which counts Queen guitarist Brian May among its celebrity supporters, was also set to benefit from the October auction of the Freddie Mercury gorilla to help support conservation projects in the Congo. A ""Freddie Lion"" had previously been commissioned for a Pride of Cape Town art trail in May. A spokesman for the Freddie Mercury estate said it would ""not be making any comment"".

Now complete the following example-
input: By Adam FlemingBBC News, Brussels At a press conference in March the Brexit Secretary David Davis and the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier unveiled a slideshow of the Brexit Treaty, with the sections agreed by both sides highlighted green. It amounted to roughly 75-80% of the 129-page document that will seal the terms of the UK's departure from the EU and which is officially called the ""Agreement on the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom"". The UK says the deadline for settling the outstanding issues is October, when the agreement will be submitted to the European Parliament. Mr Barnier wants progress on these issues in time for an EU summit on 28 June. Here is what's left to discuss: Northern Ireland Both sides have committed to avoid infrastructure on the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. Brussels has proposed a protocol - nicknamed ""the backstop"" - which would see Northern Ireland stick to those rules of the customs union and single market that are required for cross-border co-operation to continue. It's described as an insurance policy in case no other solutions are found. Britain agrees to the need for a backstop but says this version risks barriers being created between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and so wants an alternative. Solving disputes Known in the trade as ""governance"" this is an item that sounds boring but which Michel Barnier says could bring the whole deal down: how to solve disputes between the UK and the EU arising as a result of the treaty? The EU has proposed a Joint Committee made up of representatives appointed by London and Brussels. If they can't solve a problem, it would be referred to the European Court of Justice. The UK government likes the idea of ""J-Com"" but not of judges in Luxembourg having the final say. A complicated compromise to oversee the governance of the citizens' rights part of the deal hasD been agreed, though. Then there is a swathe of subjects known as Other Separation Issues (OSI's). Champagne and pasties The EU is proud of its rules that protect regional products so that champagne can only come from Champagne, Manchego cheese can only come from La Mancha, Cornish pasties from Cornwall. Brussels wants this system written into British domestic law. The Brits agree with the concept but aren't sure about the method and want to ensure it applies to British products in the EU too. Some in the food and drink industry suspect some ministers view this as a measure to protect European industries that would limit the UK's room for manoeuvre in future trade talks with other countries. Crime and courts There are still disagreements about how both sides will work together on on-going police and judicial matters. For example, the EU says that the European Court of Justice should be able to pass judgements that have an effect in the UK after the end of the transition period in cases where events occurred before the end of the transition period. On security, the UK thinks that co-operation on extradition, the British relationship with the EU crime-fighting agency Europol and the sharing of criminal records should be the subject of a separate security treaty which the two sides should begin negotiating straight away. Direct effect? The EU wants the European laws that are mentioned in the Brexit Treaty to continue to apply in the UK in the way they do now. This is the legal concept of ""direct effect"" which is at the heart of the argument over the supremacy of EU law. The UK government has agreed to write the Withdrawal Agreement into domestic legislation but is still working on the details of how to do this, before it's voted on by MPs. Nuclear material Remember the huge political row in Summer 2016 over the UK's departure from the EU's nuclear energy watchdog Euratom? Most issues related to it have been settled, apart from who will own certain radioactive material that remains in the UK - Britain or the EU countries where it originated? The signals are that a deal is close on this highly technical matter. Data British companies hold all sorts of personal data belonging to EU citizens, and the European Commission thinks that European data protection law should continue to apply to it after Brexit. The UK would like a comprehensive deal on data sharing with the EU as part of the discussions about the future relationship, and is wary of agreeing divorce-related measures that could tie its hands. Government contracts There's a section about how to handle government tenders for goods and services which will be underway during the Brexit process - so called ""public procurement"". Think new British passports being made by a Franco-Dutch firm. Most of it has been agreed, but one jargon-filled paragraph stands out as unresolved. It concerns the rule which says new contracts should be open to companies across the EU. Public procurement lawyers suspect the UK is waiting for a guarantee that British firms will be able to bid for European government business if British contracts remain open to their continental competitors. Sharing information about tax The EU wants the UK to share customs data for three years after the end of the transition period, and information about certain taxes for five years after the end of the transition period. And there are some other unresolved technical issues scattered throughout the document that test the knowledge of even the most seasoned Brexit geek. But small details could have a big effect because the whole lot has to be agreed for the deal to be signed off.

input: However after searching his home, prosecutors charged Joshua Schulte, 29, with having 10,000 child abuse images. He denies the charges and remains suspected of leaking extensive CIA data to anti-secrecy website Wikileaks. In March 2017, Wikileaks published thousands of documents detailing the spy agency's cyber-warfare programme. Mr Schulte designed malware used to break into terrorism suspects' and other targets' computers for the CIA for six years. He quit the spy agency in 2016 to work in the private sector. The 2017 breach, codenamed Vault 7, details how the CIA can take over iPhones through malware and turn smart TVs into surveillance devices and is believed to be the agency's largest leak of classified documents. US federal agencies launched a criminal investigation at the time and, according to US media, the software engineer's home in New York City was searched within a week. Agents suspected Mr Schulte of distributing ""national defence information"" and told a court they had retrieved ""NSA and CIA paperwork"", as well as electronic devices including a computer, tablet and phone, the New York Times reports. However six months later in August, instead of charging him for the Vault 7 leak, US prosecutors indicted him on unrelated child pornography charges. They allege messages sent by Mr Schulte suggest he was aware of illicit pictures being hosted on a server he created as a business while a university student in 2009. The software engineer, who denies the charges, is currently being held in a Manhattan jail after violating his bail terms. Mr Schulte's family lawyers have made repeated demands for prosecutors to either indict or clear their client of the Vault 7 allegations. A US prosecutor said in January the investigation was still continuing and that Mr Schulte remained ""a target of that investigation"", the Washington Post reports, quoting court documents. Last week, prosecutors said in court they planned to file a new indictment in the next 45 days, while his lawyer asked the judge to impose a deadline on any espionage-related charges. Both the CIA and the US justice department are yet to comment.

But advances in 3D printing technology allowed them to use a bespoke implant instead. It is believed to be one of the first times such an implant has been printed in the UK. The titanium implant was designed at Morriston and printed in Wales. ""It was a very extensive growth that needed to be removed. However, removing it also meant removing part of the breastbone and three ribs,"" cardiothoracic surgeon Ira Goldsmith said. ""That would leave a large defect that could have destabilised the entire chest wall and reconstructing it was going to be a very complex procedure,"" he added. A cement prosthesis would have been prepared during surgery, a process that would have taken about an hour and a half. Mr Maggs, from Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, has heart and other health issues so the surgeons were keen to reduce the operating time as much as possible. The titanium implant was made ahead, based on a design by Mr Goldsmith, who carried out the surgery with consultant surgeon Thomas Bragg. Mr Maggs said: ""I'm feeling good now. Mr Goldsmith is a saint to me - and Mr Bragg.""

Following Donald Trump's comments during last week's trade visit that the NHS would be ""on the table"" in any future trade talks between the UK and the USA, Eluned Morgan said there was ""absolutely no prospect whatsoever of us allowing the Welsh NHS to be part of any negotiation.""

input: The airline has said it ""expects limited disruption"" in addition to the cancelled flights. It is the result of a strike by pilots who are due to walk out for 24 hours from 01:00 BST on Thursday. The airline has said only Ireland-UK flights are affected. Ryanair and union officials met for talks on Wednesday which ended without agreement. No impact on Ireland-Europe flights According to a statement from Ryanair, the meeting lasted for seven hours. The pilots' union Fórsa, of which the Irish Airline Pilots' Association (IALPA) is a branch, had earlier said it was not optimistic that a deal could be reached to avert the strike. Flights between Ireland and Europe are set to operate as normal. ""All customers who are travelling on flights to/from Ireland on Thursday 12 July who have not received any email or text notifications of flight cancellations should travel to their departure airport as normal,"" Ryanair said in a statement. Earlier in the week the airline said it had planned for the strike by trying to ""minimise the impact"" on ""families travelling on holidays to Portugal, France, Spain, Italy and Greece"". ""We will do this by cancelling a number of flights on high frequency routes from Ireland to London and other UK destinations where customers can transfer readily to other flights."" The IALPA ballot of those directly employed by Ryanair resulted in overwhelming support - 99% - for action, although Ryanair says this only represents 27% of its workforce in the Republic of Ireland. Further strikes planned The airline has said it ""cannot rule out further disruptions in July and August"". Cabin crew in Italy will go on strike for 24-hours on 25 July, while crew in Spain, Portugal and Belgium will strike for 48 hours on 25-26 July. Unions have said further action may follow if the airline does not make concessions on some employment terms.

input: By Charlie JonesBBC News Melanie Connell felt a strange sensation in her chest and decided to go to Ipswich Hospital. Doctors said the 54-year-old had suffered a heart attack and needed surgery. Women would often experience mild chest pain similar to indigestion during a heart attack, according to the NHS. Mrs Connell, who lives in Erwarton in Suffolk, said she was doing some gardening two weeks ago when she felt a ""raw"" sensation in her chest. ""It was nothing like you see on television. No sweating, no sickness, no crushing pain, no pain shooting up my arms, jaw or neck,"" she said. The mother-of-two has a history of heart problems in her family, so when the pain reached her back, she decided to go to hospital. She said she was worried about going during the pandemic but felt it was important ""not to be frightened off"" by coronavirus. A consultant confirmed Mrs Connell had suffered a heart attack and sent her to The Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge for surgery. She was allowed to go home five days after her triple bypass and said she was now ""pottering around like an old bruised and battered tortoise"". ""Please don't feel embarrassed or worried about going to hospital. If I hadn't gone that evening, I may not have seen the morning,"" she said. Women were often unaware of their risk of a heart attack and slow to seek medical help even before the lockdown, according to research. Barbara Kobson, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""We are living in uncertain times, and it's understandable that people might feel apprehensive about going to hospital or putting unnecessary strain on the NHS. ""But heart attacks don't stop for a global pandemic. Treating them is still a top priority for the NHS and there are systems in place for them to do this.""

input: The 700 items - which also included the ex-PM's famous Gannex raincoat and a novelty HP Sauce bottle - all belonged to the Labour politician and wife Mary. The collection, from the estate of Lady Wilson, who died last year aged 102, had an initial estimate of £65,000. Wilson was born in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, in 1916. An order of service and an invitation to Sir Winston Churchill's funeral sold for £4,500 from an original estimate of £200, while a vase given by Pope Paul VI expected to sell for £1,500 reached £4,700. Christmas cards from world leaders were popular, with one from the Queen and Prince Philip tripling estimates to sell for £170. A watercolour by the Prince of Wales sold for £10,500 - believed to be a world record-breaking price. Jim Spencer, of Hansons Auctioneers, said the sale, at Bishton Hall, in Little Haywood, Staffordshire, was ""unprecedented"". ""Everything was kept over the years, every gift or signed book or presentation album of photographs. ""I don't think a prime minister's entire life has come up for auction like this before. ""But here it is, gifts from presidents, photographs, letters, Christmas cards, everything."" A Comoy's Leonardo pipe used by the former prime minister, estimated to reach up to £50, sold for £320 and Wilson's tan-coloured Gannex raincoat sold for £500, double what had been predicted. A bottle of centenary HP Sauce made specially for Wilson sold for £250. Wilson entered Parliament in the Labour landslide of 1945 as MP for Ormskirk and later becoming MP for Huyton. As prime minister he governed from 1964 to 1970 and 1974 to 1976. He resigned in 1976 and died in May 1995. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.
